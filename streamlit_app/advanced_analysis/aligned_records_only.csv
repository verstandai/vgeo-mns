SMBC Nikko Securities expects the continued expansion of eFootball's popularity.

SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast for the fiscal years ending March 2026 to March 2029 and raised its operating profit primarily due to the better-than-expected performance of 'eFootball'. As of the company's announcement on September 18, the title had surpassed 900 million cumulative downloads worldwide, demonstrating its global popularity across Japan, Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Africa. SMBC Nikko assumes that the 30th-anniversary event from July, the quality improvements such as operability in the major update in August, and the implementation of new features were well-received, leading to an increase in active users. The rising popularity of soccer leading up to the 'FIFA World Cup' to be held in June 2026 is also expected to be a tailwind. ★12:59 Maxvalu Tokai - Rebounds with 3.8% increase in same-store sales for November Maxvalu Tokai (8198) rebounded. The company announced at 12:30 PM on the 8th that its same-store sales for November, based on preliminary figures, increased by 3.8% year-on-year. Same-store customer numbers increased by 1.2%, and same-store customer spending per visit rose by 2.6%. Same-store comparisons are calculated year-on-year, adjusted for stores that have been open for 12 months after their opening month (excluding the half-year period in which they opened) and closed stores. ★13:03 CSP - Daiwa downgrades investment rating, active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market needed CSP (3086) saw a slight decline. Daiwa Securities pointed out the need for active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market. The investment rating was downgraded from '2 (Outperform)' to '3 (Neutral)', and the target price was raised from 3,100 yen to 3,160 yen. Daiwa believes that while an increase in demand due to price hikes and a perceived deterioration in public safety has been observed for the two major security companies, CSP has not fully benefited from it. It was noted that, at present, it is difficult to envision concrete strategies for expanding the customer base, excluding M&A. Operating profit forecasts are 4.55 billion yen for the fiscal year ending February 2026 and 4.44 billion yen for the fiscal year ending February 2027. It is believed that the second-half performance depends on the timing of revenue recognition for the Takanawa project, and there is a possibility of it being heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. Furthermore, it was explained that active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market are required. ★13:06 SKY Perfect JSAT - Turns positive in afternoon session, signs launch contract for next-generation satellites with U.S. SpaceX SKY Perfect JSAT Holdings (9412) turned positive in the afternoon session. The company announced at 1:00 PM on the 8th that its wholly-owned subsidiary, SKY Perfect JSAT, has selected U.S. SpaceX as a partner and signed a contract for the launch services (rocket procurement and satellite launch transportation services) of communication satellites 'JSAT-31' and 'JSAT-32'. The three next-generation satellites, including 'Superbird-9' for which a contract has already been signed, are scheduled to be launched sequentially starting in 2027. ★13:13 Toyota Motor - Mizuho raises target price, strong sense of undervaluation when looking at next fiscal year's performance Toyota Motor (7203) rebounded. Mizuho Securities pointed out a strong sense of undervaluation when looking at next fiscal year's performance. The investment rating was maintained at 'Buy', and the target price was raised from 3,400 yen to 3,700 yen. Mizuho believes that the strength in sales, particularly in the U.S., remains intact, and with the introduction of the new RAV4 and the full HEV conversion of the RAV4, robust sales trends are expected to continue. Furthermore, in the interim financial results, the company indicated its intention to once again work on improving the break-even point in terms of units, so in addition to sales, trends in costs will also be noteworthy going forward. In addition, an increase in EPS is expected next fiscal year due to a share buyback from Toyota Industries Corporation. Considering these factors, the current stock price is seen as significantly undervalued when anticipating a recovery in next fiscal year's performance. ★13:15 Mitsubishi Electric - SMBC Nikko raises target price, expects continued momentum in capital efficiency improvement Mitsubishi Electric (6503) rebounded. SMBC Nikko Securities judged that the momentum for improving capital efficiency can be expected to continue. The investment rating was maintained at '1 (Outperform)', and the target price was raised from 4,100 yen to 4,600 yen. SMBC Nikko assumes that the momentum for improving capital efficiency will continue through growth centered on infrastructure (defense, DC UPS, power infrastructure), business restructuring, fixed cost reduction measures, and a commitment to strengthening shareholder returns. It is believed that the capital market's expectations will rise to a higher level. While the operating profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 was reduced, it was increased for the fiscal year ending March 2027.

Daiwa Securities maintained its '2' investment rating and raised its target price from 11,600 yen to 19,800 yen. Earnings forecasts were revised upward, mainly for the copper foil business, with ordinary profit for the fiscal year ending March 2026 raised from 47.0 billion yen to 81.4 billion yen, and for the fiscal year ending March 2027 from 60.9 billion yen to 74.4 billion yen. It appears that the profit growth of the copper foil business, driven by the high profitability of Microthin and expanded sales of VSP for AI servers, is expected to push up the stock price.< 4480 > Medley 2405 +76 Significant rebound. SBI Securities upgraded its investment rating from 'Neutral' to 'Buy' and raised its target price from 3,000 yen to 3,900 yen. It appears that the regulatory impact of employment support payments has not had a particularly significant negative effect on the number of job openings or applications, and the number of unreported hiring decisions, etc., seems to be improving. The fading uncertainty surrounding the reporting omission issue and expectations for the pay-as-you-go portion of the medical PF are cited as reasons for the upgrade. Operating profit for the fiscal year ending December 2026 is expected to increase by over 80%.< 9983 > Fast Retailing 56580 -370 Reversal of gains. Monthly trends for November were announced the previous day. Existing store sales increased by 7.6% year-on-year, marking two consecutive months of positive growth. However, the growth rate significantly decelerated from the previous month's 25.1% increase. The number of customers increased by 2.8%, and the average customer spend also rose by 4.7%. Sales of winter items were strong, matching the drop in temperature with promotional efforts, and Thanksgiving sales also appeared to be robust. Compared to other retailers, there seemed to be no major surprises.< 9843 > Nitori HD 2646 -82.5 Significant reversal of gains. Monthly trends for November were announced the previous day. Existing store sales decreased by 5.7% year-on-year, marking three consecutive months of negative growth. Although the average customer spend increased by 3.8%, the number of customers decreased by 9.2%. It appears that sales struggled, particularly for bedding, due to average temperatures being slightly higher than usual. For the cumulative eight months up to November, existing store sales decreased by 3.4% year-on-year. The impact of the yen's depreciation on earnings continues to be viewed with caution.< 6433 > Hephaist 510 +80 Limit up, pro-rata allocation. It was reported that Japanese companies are collaborating to embark on mass production of humanoid robots. Four new companies, including Renesas and Sumitomo Heavy Industries, have joined the robot development collaboration organization established by Waseda University and Murata Manufacturing, and it appears that all 13 parties will proceed with development aiming for mass production by 2027. The company is also included among the participating companies, and it is assumed that its main area of responsibility will be joint parts, etc. Its positioning as a humanoid and physical AI-related company has been enhanced.< 6723 > Renesas 1931.5 +119 Significant continued rise. It has been partially reported that U.S. company SiTime is in discussions to acquire Renesas's timing business. The timing business is a division that manufactures devices, etc., that generate signals for electronic circuits to function properly. Potential transaction terms for the acquisition are currently under discussion. The valuation of this business, including debt, could reach up to $2 billion, which appears to be contributing to the increase in the company's stock value.< 3391 > Tsuruha HD 2760 +18 Rebound. The business integration with Welcia HD was realized on December 1st, and in response, Aeon announced the commencement of a tender offer bid (TOB) aiming to make Tsuruha HD a subsidiary. The TOB price was raised from the previous 2,280 yen to 2,900 yen, representing a 5.8% premium over the previous day's closing price. The TOB period is from today until January 6th next year. The company plans to acquire shares equivalent to 9.52% to achieve an ownership ratio of 50.9%. If a majority acquisition is not achieved, it appears that the method for achieving subsidiary status will be re-examined.< 3415 > Tokyo Base 426 +25 Significant rebound. Monthly trends for November were announced the previous day. Existing store sales increased by 15.5% year-on-year, marking 13 consecutive months of positive growth and two consecutive months of double-digit growth. Physical stores saw a 12.8% increase, and e-commerce also increased by 28.5%. Positive reactions are preceding due to double-digit growth despite the high hurdle from the previous year. Furthermore, all stores in the China business performed well, and the absence of any impact from deteriorating Japan-China relations also seems to have contributed to a sense of relief.< 4587 > PeptiDream 1462.5 -209.5 Sharp decline. The company announced a downward revision to its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending December 2025 the previous day. Revenue was revised downward from the previous forecast of 49.0 billion yen to 18.0 billion yen, and core operating profit was revised from a surplus of 21.7 billion yen to a deficit of 5.3 billion yen. Although the company had anticipated out-licensing its proprietary oral myostatin program, it appears that completing the contract within the current fiscal year has become difficult due to prolonged partnership negotiations. Although a contract is highly likely to be concluded next fiscal year, negative reactions are preceding due to the significant size of the revision.< 5741 > UACJ 1845 -202 Significant reversal of gains. Furukawa Electric, the second-largest shareholder, announced the previous day that it would sell a portion of its shares, and 13 million shares were sold through a block trade today. As a result, Furukawa Electric's ownership ratio decreased from the previous 14.34% to 7.10%. The cross trade was executed at 1,801 yen, representing a 12.0% discount compared to the previous day's closing price.

Significant continued rise. Announced a collaboration with U.S. NVIDIA to promote ""Physical AI"" for robots. This will enable robots to understand human instructions and generate appropriate movements, as well as develop robots that can work while avoiding people. Furthermore, by supporting the open-source robot development environment ""ROS,"" developers worldwide will be able to create and utilize programs to operate the company's robots. Leveraging its track record as a global leader, the company anticipates increased growth expectations due to the expansion of the Physical AI market. < 6506 > Yaskawa Electric 4212 +188. Significant rebound. Announced a collaboration with SoftBank for the practical application of AI robots. By combining the company's AI robot technology with SoftBank's information processing technology, robots will be able to perform autonomous tasks safely even in environments with many unspecified people, such as office buildings. It appears they will also be introduced in hospitals, schools, and commercial facilities, playing a role in addressing labor shortages. With news of the FANUC-NVIDIA collaboration also circulating, the future expansion of the Physical AI market is rapidly anticipated. < 7092 > FFJ 2306 +123. Significant rebound. Announced plans to take the company private through an MBO. JG35, an asset management company of the founding family, which plans to invest, will conduct a Tender Offer (TOB) at 2,315 yen per share. The TOB price represents a 6.0% premium over the previous day's closing price, leading to a movement towards the TOB price. The TOB period is scheduled from the 2nd until January 20, 2026. Amid intensifying competition due to the increase in low-cost gyms, the company reportedly plans to accelerate new store openings by going private. < 3407 > Asahi Kasei 1272 +25. Significant rebound. Announced an agreement with Teijin to integrate their respective textile trading subsidiaries in October 2026. Teijin Frontier and Asahi Kasei Advance will merge, with Teijin Frontier as the surviving company. After the merger, Teijin will hold an 80% stake and Asahi Kasei will hold 20%. This development is expected to bring benefits such as economies of scale, and for Asahi Kasei, it will also enable the concentration of management resources into high-profit businesses like healthcare. Buying activity is leading for both companies, and for Asahi Kasei, there is also a rebound effect from the sharp decline towards the close of the previous day. < 4665 > Duskin 4258 +266. Significant rebound. Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities upgraded its investment rating from ""Underweight"" to ""Equal-weight"" and raised its target price from 2,800 yen to 4,300 yen. It pointed out that the increasing proportion of the food business, centered on Mister Donut, makes it easier to consider restaurant valuations, and it appears they have changed the applicable valuation metric from PBR to PER. Furthermore, reflecting the strong performance of existing Mister Donut stores, the company has also revised its earnings forecast upward. < 8306 > Mitsubishi UFJ 2523.5 +60.5. Significant continued rise. The banking sector is the second-highest gainer by industry today, continuing its upward trend. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda stated at a press conference the previous day that even with an interest rate hike, ""the situation is still accommodative,"" and expressed his intention to ""appropriately judge the necessity of an interest rate hike"" at the Monetary Policy Meeting to be held on the 18th-19th. In response, an additional interest rate hike at the December meeting is now strongly priced in. The yield on 10-year government bonds, a benchmark for long-term interest rates, temporarily rose to 1.880%, reaching its highest level in approximately 17 and a half years. < 7564 > Workman 6720 -260. Significant continued decline. Announced its monthly trends for November the previous day. Existing store sales increased by 7.9% year-on-year, a deceleration from the 19.5% increase in the previous month. Since the last monthly announcement, the stock price had been on an upward trend, so selling to close positions seems to be dominant due to the slowdown in the sales growth rate. The number of customers increased by 5.3%, and the average customer spend also rose by 2.5%, but both figures represent a slowdown compared to the previous month's growth. It appears that colder temperatures supported sales of winter clothing. < 2678 > Askul 1391 -32. Significant continued decline. Announced the postponement of its first-half financial results disclosure, which was scheduled for December 15. This is due to the suspension of orders on its e-commerce site following a cyberattack, and the time required to calculate the extent of the damage. The company also announced its monthly trends for November, with sales significantly down by 95% year-on-year, and a sharp decline in its consumer-向け ""LOHACO"" business. While this was somewhat anticipated, limiting the surprise, there is currently no clear timeline for the full recovery of LOHACO, which is being viewed as a negative factor. < 2593 > Ito En 3053 -120. Significant continued decline. Announced its first-half financial results the previous day, with operating profit at 13.9 billion yen, a 3.2% decrease year-on-year. This marks a shift from a 17.3% increase in the first quarter to a decline in profit, and market expectations are believed to have been missed by approximately 2 billion yen. There is also a view that the hurdle for achieving the unchanged full-year plan of 25.5 billion yen, an 11.0% increase from the previous fiscal year, has risen. The background is the deterioration in profitability of domestic beverages, where the impact of higher raw material and ingredient costs is significant, and the effect of price increases appears to be limited. < 3465 > KEIICHI STAR 6290 +230. Significant continued rise. SMBC Nikko Securities upgraded its investment rating from ""2"" to ""1"" and raised its target price from 5,500 yen to 7,300 yen. It believes there is a possibility of an upward revision being announced when the third-quarter financial results are released, and strong guidance can be expected for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to an increase in the number of condominium units sold.

The Nikkei Shimbun Digital Edition reported at 2:00 on the 2nd that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has decided to recommend that Suzuki's wholly-owned subsidiary, Snic, take measures to prevent recurrence, on the grounds that setting significantly low order prices for parts of automobiles whose mass production has ended constitutes a violation of the Subcontract Act (unjustly low pricing).

Nomura expects sales growth driven by domestic DX demand, in addition to improved profitability through the utilization of AI. Domestically, they anticipate steady business expansion in consulting and financial SaaS businesses, as well as a recovery in sales in industrial IT, where sales growth had been slowing due to investment restraint from large clients, high growth in security-related areas with strong demand, and improved profitability through AI utilization, primarily in financial IT. For the fiscal year ending March 2027, they forecast a 15% increase in operating profit year-on-year, driven by improved profitability through AI utilization, increased revenue in each business segment, and profit improvement due to the reduction of structural reform costs overseas and cost control.

Nomura pointed out that the operating profit of 7.9 billion yen for Q4 and the operating profit plan of 37.6 billion yen for the fiscal year ending September 2026 exceeded Nomura's previous forecasts. They believe that the planned 20% operating profit growth rate for the fiscal year ending September 2026 could be surpassed depending on upfront investments and cost management. It was commented that for the fiscal year ending September 2026, due to the impact of the departure of specific merchants, the operating profit growth rate for Q1 will slightly decelerate to 18% year-on-year, but is expected to improve to the 20% range from Q3 onwards. Payment demand is robust, a pipeline of large projects for PG alone is anticipated until the fiscal year ending September 2028, and the basis for calculating the operating profit target of 100 billion yen for 2030-31 has also been presented, suggesting that the company can be evaluated based on its medium- to long-term performance.

Daiwa expects consolidated net profit for the full fiscal year 2025 to be 1.5 trillion yen (a 27% increase year-on-year), achieving the bank's target. It was pointed out that while stock performance has been strong since the recent positive earnings announcement, the sense of being undervalued over the past year has not been corrected, and the stock still appears inexpensive based on various valuations. In preparation for the next medium-term management plan scheduled to start next fiscal year, the disposal of low-profit assets is expected to proceed this fiscal year, and the certainty of future profit growth is likely to increase.

Additionally, they believe that operating profit growth is possible for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to improved demand accompanying lower US interest rates. On the other hand, they noted that momentum in automotive demand, a key customer for the company, is difficult to anticipate, and it is currently hard to find an equity story beyond an increase in sales volume, thus lacking further positive catalysts. While they stated that the stock price could rise strongly if a robust demand recovery due to the return of manufacturing to the US is confirmed, they are primarily looking forward to the disclosure of a medium-term management plan and ROE targets to identify an equity story.

SMBC Nikko judged that its competitive advantage has not been undermined. It maintained its investment rating at ""1 (Outperform)"" and raised its target price from 5,900 yen to 6,000 yen. SMBC Nikko believes that there are still no signs of improvement in the U.S. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) market, making a short-term recovery difficult to expect. On the other hand, it assumes that improvement is highly likely from 2027 onwards due to the U.S. housing market returning to a growth trajectory. Regarding semiconductor materials, it judged that demand related to AI is increasingly likely to grow at a faster pace than previously expected. Considering the difference in profit margins with competitors, it believes that its competitive advantage in its core businesses has not been undermined, and taking into account the undervaluation of its valuation metrics, there is significant upside potential when an improvement in the external environment is factored in. Kyowa Electric extended its rally for a fifth consecutive day. The company announced on the 25th that it would cancel 1,814,800 shares of its own stock.

It maintained its investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised its target price from 1,600 yen to 1,900 yen. SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast based on the Q2 FY26.3 earnings announcement and subsequent interviews. The company's three pillars for addressing the Opdivo cliff are mitigating sales decline through Opdivo subcutaneous injection, growth of Deciphera products, and growth of in-house developed products. Among these, the current revision incorporates the successful Phase 2 trial of the next-generation immunotherapy ""ONO-4578"" for gastric cancer and the successful Phase 2 trial of the multiple system atrophy treatment ""ONO-2808"" in relation to the growth of in-house developed products.

It evaluated that the company's rental, income-generating real estate, and condominium sales businesses are progressing more favorably than expected, with accelerating increases in office rents and real estate prices against the backdrop of inflation. It believes that the likelihood of an upside deviation from the medium-term plan announced in January this year has increased. It noted that attention would be on whether profit and ROE targets, among others, would be raised at the full-year financial results announcement in February next year.

●【1】Today's Stock Market & Featured Stocks at a Glance!
AI-related stocks rapidly lose momentum, reversing from a 600-yen gain to a fall.

[Today's Market] Nikkei Stock Average slightly falls back!
On the U.S. market on the 10th, major stock indices all rose. Investor sentiment improved due to rising expectations that the government shutdown would be lifted within a few days, and a significant rise in tech stocks, particularly semiconductor giant Nvidia, which reportedly received increased production requests from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Although news of the government shutdown lifting had been circulating since the previous day, the Nikkei Stock Average briefly rose to 51,513.16 yen (+601.4 yen) in early trading today. Expectations seemed to have further increased with reports that a provisional budget bill was expected to pass not only the Senate but also the House of Representatives in the U.S. soon. On the other hand, as AI (Artificial Intelligence)-related stocks, which had been bought temporarily, lost momentum, the market saw volatile movements, turning downward in the afternoon. Major general contractors such as Kajima Corporation and Taisei Corporation, which revised their earnings and dividend forecasts upward, surged in the afternoon. Meanwhile, declines were prominent in some semiconductor stocks like Advantest and Fujikura, and wire and cable stocks. KOKUSAI ELECTRIC, which revised its earnings forecast downward during trading hours, plummeted towards the end of trading.

[Today's Featured Stocks]
◆Shiseido (4911) 2,562.5 yen (-23.0 yen)
Operating loss for the cumulative third quarter (January-September) of the fiscal year ending December 2025 was 33.3 billion yen (compared to a 2.1 billion yen profit in the same period of the previous year). An unexpected loss was incurred due to impairment in the Americas business, but sales improved both domestically and internationally, and core operating profit, excluding temporary factors, increased by 9.7% year-on-year to 30 billion yen, exceeding market expectations. The company stated that structural reforms are progressing smoothly and expressed confidence in achieving the targets set in its medium-term management plan. It seems to have been perceived as all bad news being priced in, and the stock price saw moments of significant rise.

◆Sony Group (6758) 4,520 yen (+236 yen)
Announced financial results for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 at noon today. Operating profit increased by 20.4% year-on-year to 768.9 billion yen, exceeding market expectations. Furthermore, the full-year plan was revised upward from 1.33 trillion yen to 1.43 trillion yen (a 12.0% increase year-on-year). In addition to the music business, which benefited from the movie ""Demon Slayer,"" image sensors for mobile devices, where unit prices for new products for major customers increased and shipment volumes exceeded expectations, seem to be performing well.

◆Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012) 10,685 yen (-695 yen)
Pre-tax profit for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 increased by 49.0% year-on-year to 35.3 billion yen, a double-digit increase, but fell short of market expectations. The full-year plan for net sales was revised upward from 2.29 trillion yen to 2.34 trillion yen (a 9.9% increase year-on-year), but profits were kept at a level below market expectations, considering the impact of tariffs. Order intake was also revised upward, driven by an increase in aircraft engines for the Ministry of Defense and commercial aircraft, but this seems to have been perceived as unsatisfactory.

●【2】Tuesday Corner ""Investment & Money Questions"" What happens to taxes when you sell gold?
(Question) I want to sell the pure gold I've been accumulating, how will it be taxed?
(Answer) If the annual profit from sale is 500,000 yen or less, it is tax-exempt. If it exceeds 500,000 yen, the taxable amount changes depending on the holding period!

""Gold"" is attracting attention due to soaring prices. Many people, like the questioner, are likely considering selling to realize profits. However, if you are accumulating pure gold, or holding physical gold such as bullion or jewelry, taxation upon sale is somewhat complex. The two main points are: ① whether the sale ""profit"" is 500,000 yen or less, and ② whether the holding period is more than 5 years. Let's check below.

Profits from selling gold held in forms such as pure gold accumulation, bullion, or jewelry are classified as capital gains. First, calculate the profit from sale by subtracting (acquisition cost + selling fees) from the sale price. If you sell multiple times within a year, sum them up to calculate the total annual profit from sale. From that, subtract the special deduction for capital gains of 500,000 yen, and the remaining amount is subject to taxation. In other words, if the profit from sale is 500,000 yen or less, it becomes tax-exempt due to the special deduction, and a tax return is not required. This is point ①. For those who want to save on taxes, one strategy is to divide the selling timing across different years to keep the annual profit from sale within 500,000 yen.

If the profit from sale exceeds 500,000 yen, the amount that could not be fully deducted by the special deduction becomes taxable. What needs to be checked here is point ②: ""Is the holding period more than 5 years?"" If the gold holding period is more than 5 years, it is classified as ""long-term capital gains,"" and the taxable amount is reduced by half. Expressed as a formula, the taxable amount becomes: {Sale Price - (Acquisition Cost + Selling Fees) - Special Deduction of 500,000 yen} ÷ 2. On the other hand, if the holding period is 5 years or less, it is classified as ""short-term capital gains,"" and there is no reduction measure for the taxable amount. If the gold being sold includes both short-term and long-term holdings, calculate the taxable income for short-term and long-term separately, and then sum them up. Note that the special deduction of 500,000 yen is for both short-term and long-term combined. If short-term and long-term are mixed, it is applied preferentially to the calculation of short-term capital gains.

Capital gains from gold are subject to comprehensive taxation, and a tax return is required. The calculated taxable amount is combined with other income, such as employment income, to determine the tax rate. As can be understood from the explanation so far, calculating the taxable amount requires knowing the gold's acquisition date (for determining the holding period) and acquisition cost. When purchasing gold or jewelry at a store, be sure to keep necessary records such as proof of purchase or receipts. In cases where the acquisition cost is unknown, such as when gold is acquired through inheritance, it is common to calculate ""5% of the sale price"" as the deemed acquisition cost. In other cases, if there is a reasonable and objectively explainable reason, such as determining the year of manufacture from the number engraved on the gold and using the lowest retail price from that year onward as the deemed acquisition cost, it may be accepted. For how to handle cases where the acquisition cost is unknown, it is advisable to consult with a tax office or a tax accountant. Furthermore, if the sale price of gold exceeds 2 million yen, submission of a My Number Card to the buyer is mandatory, and the transaction record will also be shared by the buyer with the tax office. This means that if you do not file a tax return, there is a high probability that the tax office will point out an undeclared income. Even if it's a bit troublesome, if a taxable amount arises from the sale of gold, be sure to declare it.

Revenue increased due to growth in the Toy and Hobby business and stable performance in the Amusement business. On the other hand, each profit item remained in decline, affected by factors such as a decrease in profit margin due to reduced sales of repeat titles in the Digital business, and a reactionary decline following the success of multiple theatrical releases in the Visual and Music business during the same period of the previous year. Net sales: 643,816 million yen (up 5.3% year-on-year), Operating profit: 105,481 million yen (down 7.2% year-on-year), Ordinary profit: 110,196 million yen (down 4.6% year-on-year), Net profit: 78,909 million yen (down 2.3% year-on-year). The situation for each main segment is as follows.

① Toy and Hobby Business: Net sales: 317,830 million yen (up 9.0% year-on-year), Segment profit: 65,035 million yen (up 8.9% year-on-year). Despite being partially affected by tariffs, the business performed strongly due to the expansion of product categories and lineups both domestically and internationally, the expansion of customer touchpoints through real events and stores, and the strengthening of production systems and distribution. Specifically, products for high-target (adult) demographics, such as Gunpla (plastic models from the Gundam series), collector's figures, and Ichiban Kuji (character lottery), performed well due to strengthened sales and marketing efforts and an expanded product lineup. Additionally, card products such as trading card games, Gashapon (capsule toys), and confectionery/food products contributed to performance through the expansion of product lineups, target demographics, and operating regions, as well as the strengthening of customer touchpoints. Furthermore, Tamagotchi-related products, including the new product ""Tamagotchi Paradise,"" gained popularity both domestically and internationally.

② Digital Business: Net sales: 231,504 million yen (up 1.3% year-on-year), Segment profit: 37,386 million yen (down 16.4% year-on-year). In network content, the new app title ""SD Gundam G Generation Eternal"" performed strongly, attracting new fan demographics. Additionally, major app titles such as the ""DRAGON BALL"" series, ""ONE PIECE,"" and ""THE IDOLM@STER"" series performed stably due to continuous initiatives targeting users. In home video games, the new title ""ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN"" was a worldwide hit, and ""Tamagotchi no Puchi Puchi Omisechi Omachido~sama!"" gained popularity due to synergistic buzz with the Toy and Hobby business. On the other hand, differences in the composition of home video game titles affected performance, such as a decrease in sales volume of repeat titles compared to the same period of the previous year. The Digital business will continue to aim for title development that prioritizes quality and meets fan expectations, and will work to build a balanced and optimal title portfolio.

③ Visual and Music Business (formerly IP Production Business): Net sales: 41,078 million yen (down 0.5% year-on-year), Segment profit: 5,359 million yen (down 20.2% year-on-year). The new visual work in the Gundam series, ""Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX,"" gained popularity by attracting new fan demographics in addition to existing fans, and contributed to performance through theatrical box office revenue, global video distribution, and licensing of products and services. Additionally, global expansion and video distribution of existing Gundam series and ""Blue Lock,"" among others, performed stably. Overall, the Visual and Music business did not reach the level of the same period of the previous year, when theatrical box office revenue from multiple hit theatrical releases significantly contributed to performance.

④ Amusement Business: Net sales: 75,380 million yen (up 5.2% year-on-year), Segment profit: 7,046 million yen (down 3.4% year-on-year). Existing store sales at domestic amusement facilities were 106.0% compared to the same period of the previous year. Additionally, Bandai Namco's unique facilities, such as ""Bandai Namco Cross Store"" and ""Gashapon Department Store,"" which are linked with the group's products and services, as well as activity facilities, performed strongly. In the sale of arcade games, ""Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. 2 Infinite Boost"" performed strongly. In the Amusement business, the role of fan touchpoints will be further strengthened to expand awareness of the group's products and services.

They forecast the growth rate of 3.5-inch glass substrates to be in the low teens annually for FY25-26, accelerating to the high teens in FY27 due to contributions from shipments to two new customers. They expect the profitability of healthcare, which was low in July-September, to improve to approximately 20% from FY26 onwards, which is the company's guideline.
