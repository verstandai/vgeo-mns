With five cost-increase projects remaining, it believes it is too early to price in further expectations.

Ohara <5218> saw a sharp decline. The company announced on the 11th that it expects consolidated operating profit for the full fiscal year ending October 2026 to be 1.10 billion yen (down 38.7% year-on-year), and its annual dividend forecast to be 25 yen (25 yen in the previous fiscal year). While the optical business will proceed with price revisions and cost reductions, expenses related to addressing rare earth procurement risks are expected to arise. The electronics business is expected to be affected by a decline in profitability due to inventory adjustments for products for semiconductor lithography equipment, as well as the impact of U.S. tariff policies. Assumed exchange rates are 1 dollar = 150 yen and 1 euro = 165 yen. Consolidated operating profit for the full fiscal year ending October 2025 was 1.79 billion yen (down 17.6% from the previous fiscal year). This was impacted by a decrease in the operating rate of production facilities due to inventory adjustments for products for semiconductor lithography equipment, and changes in the product mix.★9:38 Ohara - Sharp Decline: Share Buyback Up to 630,000 Shares and 891 Million Yen; Ratio is 2.59%. Ohara <5218> saw a sharp decline. The company announced on the 11th that it has set up a share buyback framework with an upper limit of 630,000 shares and 891 million yen. The acquisition period is from December 12, 2025, to April 10, 2026. The acquisition method will be market purchases on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (including purchases via ToSTNeT-3 off-auction own share trading). If the maximum number of shares is acquired, the ratio to the total number of outstanding shares excluding treasury stock will be 2.59%. Furthermore, with the earnings announced on the same day forecasting a decrease in profit for the current fiscal year, selling pressure has become dominant.★9:39 Ridge-i - Sharp Decline: Q1 Operating Profit Down 29%; Large Satellite AI Project Completed and Moved to Maintenance and Operations Phase. Ridge-i <5572> saw a sharp decline. The company announced on the 11th that its consolidated operating profit for Q1 (August-October) of the fiscal year ending July 2026 was 71 million yen (down 29.1% year-on-year). This was impacted by the completion of a large satellite AI project from the previous fiscal year, which transitioned to the maintenance and operations phase, and a decrease in revenue due to a reduction in marketing projects from platform providers.★9:42 SoftBank Group - Surging: Reported to be in Talks to Acquire U.S. Data Center Operator Switch. SoftBank Group <9984> surged. Bloomberg reported at 8:59 AM on the 12th that the company is in talks to acquire Switch, a U.S. data center operator. According to the article, sources revealed this information. Agreement on transaction terms has not yet been reached, and it appears uncertain whether an actual deal will materialize. The acquisition of Switch would be one of the largest deals for the company to date, and it is expected to require a massive amount of funding.★9:42 Panasonic HD - Nomura Raises Target Price: Confidence in Growth Strategy Post-Structural Reform Increases. Panasonic Holdings <6752> continued its significant rally. Nomura Securities pointed out that confidence in the growth strategy post-structural reform is increasing. It maintained its 'Buy' investment rating and raised its target price from 2,400 yen to 2,500 yen. Nomura expects initiatives such as personnel optimization, consolidation and abolition of bases, and centralization and efficiency improvement of indirect functions to progress, leading to a 38% increase in operating profit (adjusted) for the fiscal year ending March 2027 compared to the previous fiscal year, due to the effects of structural reforms. It also anticipates profit improvements in individual businesses, such as the expansion of energy storage systems for data centers (DC) and the reduction of losses at Blue Yonder. The review of the business portfolio from a best owner perspective is also progressing, including the decision to sell the housing equipment business. It believes that the certainty of profit growth has increased, based on factors such as the order acquisition status for DCs towards 2028.★9:46 FCC - SMBC Nikko Raises Target Price: Awareness of Capital Efficiency Expected to Rise. FCC <7296> saw a significant four-day rally, interspersed with unchanged trading. SMBC Nikko Securities judged that awareness of capital efficiency would increase. It raised its investment rating from '2 (Neutral)' to '1 (Outperform)' and its target price from 3,600 yen to 4,200 yen. SMBC Nikko views FCC as the supplier that will benefit most from the current expansion of the two-wheeler market in India, where it holds a high market share. The sustainability of the clutch business is also increasing due to the strengthening of the HV/PHV business in the U.S. In the new medium-term plan, it notes that there remains room for enhanced shareholder returns aimed at curbing the rising equity ratio.★9:49 Top Culture - Surging: Forecasts Turn to Operating Profit for Current Fiscal Year; Previous Fiscal Year Saw Reduced Loss. Top Culture <7640> surged. The company announced on the 11th that it expects consolidated operating profit for the full fiscal year ending October 2026 to turn profitable at 400 million yen. It aims for an early return to profitability by strengthening original projects, measures, and e-commerce sales, accelerating business development centered on books and the introduction of new products and projects, and implementing store renovations and operational efficiency improvements. For the fiscal year ending October 2025, it reported a loss of 390 million yen (compared to a loss of 500 million yen in the previous fiscal year). While profitability improved at existing stores, the company incurred a loss due to a significant increase in costs associated with store closures and renovations.",Traders Web,2025-12-12,Neutral,Diverged,-4.107324063592139,9.91210413624616,Diverged,T+1,Strong,2175.0,6.905873679036619,3593.0,1.929078014184397,4.976795664852221,2.2364217252396164,4.567307692307692,0.9269662921348315,2.3385840444157693,2.556717637355616,4.246286874227058,2154.0,-0.9655172413793104,3606.0,0.36181463957695514,-1.3273318809562655,-1.5862068965517242,0.6306937631394535,0.8389261744966443,-0.6653637211168295,1.23334956360092,0.5102046599945644

現在値 ソニーＧ 4,181 + 81 メガチプス 8,070 + 10 バンナムＨ 4,282 -20 任天堂 11,730 + 330.00 近鉄ＧＨＤ 2,961.5 + 39 ●バンナムは「ガンダム」IP好調も、下期の業績はダウントレンドか 先月に続いて、筆者がウォッチしている各企業の2026年3月期第2四半期（25年7-9月期）の決算動向をまとめていきたい。まずはゲームセクターである。バンダイナムコホールディングス < 7832 > の26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）は、前回の第1四半期（25年4-6月期）決算時に上方修正した数字を上回る形で着地し、前年同期比7％の営業減益ながらも比較的堅調な決算だった。筆者が第１四半期決算時に述べたように、「機動戦士ガンダム」シリーズの好調が大きな要因となっている。テレビアニメ「機動戦士Gundam GQuuuuuuX（ガンダムジークアクス）」が人気となったことや、大阪・関西万博での展示が好評だったからである。第1四半期時に「ガンダム関連のIP（知的財産）の売上高は2000億円に迫りそうだ」と想定したが、今回の決算での会社発表ではさらにそれを上回り、2300億円に上方修正されている。上期までの好調に合わせて通期計画も上方修正されたものの、26年3月期通期では上期同様に減益計画である。これは下期にゲームソフトの大型タイトルが予定されていないこと、万博効果の剥落などが想定されているためである。グループ会社が運営する動画配信サービス「バンダイチャンネル」が不正アクセスで停止している問題も含めて、下期の業績は若干、ダウントレンドになるのではないかという見方もあり、株価的にはネガティブに受け止められているようだ。ただ、中長期的には多彩なIPを持つ同社の業績は世界的なアニメ文化の広がりもあって、アニメやゲームを中心に拡大傾向が続くと見ている。次にソニーグループ < 6758 > の決算だが、26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）は非常に良かった。「プレイステーション（PS）5」のハード販売は依然として前モデル「PS4」のペースを下回っているものの、継続的な課金収入を得るリカーリングビジネスが全体的に好調で、オンラインサービスの堅調さもあり、ゲーム事業の利益は安定的に創出されている。孫会社のアニプレックスが手掛ける劇場版アニメ「鬼滅の刃」最新作に加え、実写映画の「国宝」も邦画としては異例のヒットとなっており、同グループのコンテンツ企業としての地位は高まっていると言えるだろう。スマートフォン（スマホ）用のCMOSセンサーも含めて、文句のない好決算だったと捉えている。今回の決算で同社は通期業績予想を上方修正したが、CMOSセンサーは顧客企業のスマホの販売好調が伝えられていることもあり、さらなる上振れも期待できそうだ。●日本のゲームユーザーの間でプレステへの関心が低下した理由もうひとつ、 前回も触れたが、ソニーグループは「PS5デジタル・エディション」の日本語専用モデルで実質的に大幅な値下げを行った。だが「ファミ通」が調査している販売データを見る限り、任天堂 < 7974 > の新型ゲーム機「Switch2」に迫ることはできなかった。これは同モデルにディスクドライブが装着されていないことで、ディスクドライブを使うかもしれないと考えるユーザーたちから、「買うに至らない」と思われてしまったことが要因のようだ。一部のメディアが頑張って盛り上げようとしているのとは裏腹に、「プレイステーション」に対するユーザーの関心が低下しているように筆者には思えてならない。この大幅値下げにも関わらず、「Switch2」に大きく後れを取った週販の結果を見れば、かつて筆者が予想していた「『プレイステーション』ブランドは凋落する」という説が正しかった、と言わざるを得ない。同社に取材しても、日本のシェアが低いことがこの国内専用モデル発売の要因だとしていたので、危機感はあるのだと思う。だが、私が指摘したことをもっと真剣に受け止めて対処していたら違う結果になったのではないか、というのが本音である。当時、日本ではスマホゲームが隆盛で、世界市場の約半分を占める米国市場が活況となると、同社が日本市場を軽視したくなるのも無理はなかったとは思う。米国市場開拓への戦略をシビアに立てる一方、日本や欧州では競合としては比較的戦いやすいマイクロソフトばかりを意識してきた経営が、日本市場での「プレイステーション」の存在感低下を招いてしまったのではないかと考えざるを得ない。幸い同社全体の業績は堅調で資金力もある。ぜひ、ゲーム事業でも日本市場の立て直しにまい進してもらいたいものだ。●AIブームの負の側面、半導体不足でゲーム機や電子機器の価格が上昇電子部品、半導体ではメガチップス < 6875 > の26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）決算に触れておきたい。同社はゲーム機用のソフト格納用半導体が主力だが、過去に投資し、持ち株を一部売却した米企業、サイタイム（SiTime）の株価が大きく上昇しているため話題になっている。サイタイムはタイミングデバイスという電子機器に欠かせない部品を供給しており、AI（人工知能）ブームで人気になった銘柄である。持ち株比率は徐々に下がっているのだが、サイタイムの株価上昇によってメガチップスの資産価値は逆に上昇しており、11月末に26年3月期通期の純利益を上方修正している。これは前回計画よりも高い価格でサイタイムの株式を売却できたことが要因のようだ。AI関連では、先月も触れたように、米ハイテク大手企業によって ""驚愕""と言えるほどの巨額の設備投資が行われており、GPU（画像処理半導体）だけでなく、DRAMやフラッシュメモリー、HDD（ハードディスクドライブ）など、多くの電子部材が需給バランスを崩している。すでに自作パソコン用のメモリーでも、店頭での販売制限が行われるようになっているほどだ。まだ読者の方々には実感が乏しいと思うのだが、AIへの巨額投資がこのまま続くなら、来年はゲームセクターにもかなり大きな影響が出そうな雰囲気である。「PS5」は24年に部材を安く調達できたらしく値下げを繰り返したが、今後は不透明だ。「Switch2」もDRAM、フラッシュメモリーともに前モデルの「Switch」よりも使用量が増えており、トランプ関税の影響も考えると、価格情勢が不透明になっている。「Switch2」はこのままメモリーなどの価格が上がりコスト負担が増すような事態になると、26年の販売台数が増えるほど、損失が出るような状況も想定しないといけないと思う。特に「Switch2」の2年目である26年は、適切な施策で販売台数を大きく伸ばしたいタイミングでもある。任天堂は価格と調達量をよく考える必要があろう。日本では需要が強く、多少の値上げは容認されると思われる。新たなカラーリングなどの施策に合わせて、値上げも考えないといけない局面もあり得よう。ゲーム機を例に挙げたが、AIブームはスマホやパソコンなどの価格にも大きな影響を及ぼしているように思う。筆者も生成AIは試していて、その成果物を見れば確かに性能の高さは理解できるのだが、半面、マネタイズはいま一つうまくいっていない印象がある。ブームを本物に変えられるかが26年後半以降に問われることになるだろう。●人気Vチューバーのイベントで盛り上がる近鉄に期待鉄道セクターでは近鉄グループホールディングス < 9041 > を取り上げたい。26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）決算自体には大きなサプライズはなかったものの、万博効果は期初計画の125億円を大きく上回る250億円となる見込みだという。これほど好調だと下期以降の影響が懸念されるのだが、前回もお伝えした通り、志摩スペイン村で3回目となる、にじさんじ（ＡＮＹＣＯＬＯＲ（エニーカラー） < 5032 > 運営の人気Vチューバーグループ）所属の周央サンゴさんを中心とした「七次元生徒会」のイベントが実施されている。筆者も先日、志摩スペイン村を訪れたのだが、平日ながら若い人たちを、スペイン村最寄りの鵜方駅で多数見かけたので、改めてVチューバー人気の高さを確認した次第である。三重交通（三重交通グループホールディングス < 3232 > 傘下）が志摩スペイン村へのバスを大幅に増発するなど、以前の閑散としたイメージとは打って変わった印象だ。近鉄グループによると、今回のイベントの初動来場者は、前回に比べて大幅に増えたそうで、動画コンテンツ一本の力で、ここまで集客に変化を生む時代がやってきたというのは感慨深い。同社の伊勢志摩特急の利用も堅調とのことなので、将来性も含めて楽しみである。ところで鉄道セクターでは、日中関係が急速に悪化したことによるインバウンドの減少が懸念材料として挙げられている。もちろん、今後の動向は注視する必要があるだろうが、筆者は大幅な減少は想定していない。初期の頃のインバウンドに比べると多様化も進んでいて、中国の旅行者頼りの状況ではなくなっているからだ。最後にJR九州 < 9142 > にも改めて触れておきたい。26年3月期第2四半期（25年7-9月期）決算については前回すでに述べたが、11月に「JR博多シティ」に開店した「Nintendo FUKUOKA（ニンテンドーフクオカ）」が大いに盛り上がっているのである。オープン初日は午前5時から並ぶ人が現れたそうで、マグカップ付きのホットチョコレートの販売も期間限定で行われ、これも大盛況だった。SNSでは整理券配布の混乱や転売などの問題も見られたようだが、筆者はこれらによって人気の高さを再確認できたと考えている。むしろこうした事象がメディアで取り上げられたことで、全国的に「JR博多シティ」の知名度向上につながったのではないだろうか。鉄道会社はどうしても沿線の顧客を重視しがちであるが、テナント販売からの収益も大きな収益源である。地域ローカルの需要だけでなく、首都圏を含めた広範な人の動きを引き込むことで、さらに成長を図ることができるのではないかと考えている。各社の決算は総じて良好だったが、相場全体を見渡せば、現時点では株価的にはAI銘柄に偏りがあるのは確かだと思う。そのすそ野が広がるかどうかが、バブルか否かの分かれ目だと考えている。今後も各社の動向を追って、お伝えしていきたい。","Hideki

strong, but will second-half performance trend downwards? Following last month, I would like to summarize the earnings trends for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (July-September 2025) for the companies I am watching. First, the game sector. Bandai Namco Holdings <7832>'s first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025) exceeded the figures revised upward during the previous first quarter (April-June 2025) earnings announcement, resulting in a relatively solid performance despite a 7% year-on-year decrease in operating profit. As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings announcement, the strong performance of the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" series is a major factor. This is due to the popularity of the TV anime ""Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX"" and the favorable reception of its exhibition at the Osaka-Kansai Expo. While I had estimated during the first quarter that ""sales of Gundam-related IP (intellectual property) would approach 200 billion yen,"" the company's announcement in this earnings report further exceeded that, revising it upward to 230 billion yen. Although the full-year plan was also revised upward in line with the strong first-half performance, the full fiscal year ending March 2026 is still projected to see a decrease in profit, similar to the first half. This is because no major game software titles are scheduled for the second half, and the fading effect of the Expo is anticipated. Including the issue of the video streaming service ""Bandai Channel,"" operated by a group company, being suspended due to unauthorized access, there is a view that second-half performance might trend slightly downwards, which seems to be negatively perceived by the stock market. However, in the medium to long term, I believe the company's performance, with its diverse IP portfolio, will continue to expand, primarily driven by anime and games, supported by the global spread of anime culture. Next, regarding Sony Group <6758>'s earnings, the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025) was very strong. Although hardware sales of ""PlayStation (PS) 5"" are still below the pace of its predecessor ""PS4,"" recurring revenue businesses, which generate continuous subscription income, are generally strong, and robust online services are contributing to stable profit generation in the game business. In addition to the latest animated film ""Demon Slayer"" produced by its subsidiary Aniplex, the live-action film ""National Treasure"" has also become an unusual hit for a Japanese film, indicating that the group's position as a content company is strengthening. I view this as an unblemished strong earnings report, including CMOS sensors for smartphones. The company revised its full-year earnings forecast upward in this report, and with strong sales reported for customer companies' smartphones, further upside for CMOS sensors can be expected. ●Reasons for declining interest in PlayStation among Japanese game users. Another point, which I also touched upon last time, is that Sony Group effectively made a significant price reduction for the ""PS5 Digital Edition"" with a Japan-exclusive model. However, looking at the sales data surveyed by ""Famitsu,"" it was unable to catch up with Nintendo <7974>'s new game console ""Switch 2."" This seems to be due to the fact that the model does not have a disc drive, leading users who might consider using a disc drive to think, ""it's not worth buying."" Contrary to some media outlets' efforts to promote it, it seems to me that user interest in ""PlayStation"" is declining. Despite this significant price cut, looking at the weekly sales results, which lagged significantly behind ""Switch 2,"" I have to say that my previous prediction that ""the 'PlayStation' brand would decline"" was correct. Even when interviewing the company, they stated that the low market share in Japan was a factor in launching this Japan-exclusive model, so I believe they do have a sense of crisis. However, my honest opinion is that if they had taken my points more seriously and addressed them, the outcome might have been different. At the time, smartphone games were booming in Japan, and with the US market, which accounts for about half of the global market, becoming active, it's understandable that the company might have been inclined to neglect the Japanese market. While they developed a rigorous strategy for US market expansion, their management, which focused only on Microsoft as a relatively easy competitor to fight in Japan and Europe, inevitably led to the decline in PlayStation's presence in the Japanese market. Fortunately, the company's overall performance is strong, and it has financial resources. I sincerely hope they will strive to rebuild the Japanese market in their game business. ●Negative aspects of the AI boom: Rising prices for game consoles and electronic devices due to semiconductor shortages. Regarding electronic components and semiconductors, I would like to touch upon MegaChips <6875>'s first-half earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025). The company's main business is semiconductors for storing game software, but it is attracting attention because the stock price of SiTime, a US company in which MegaChips previously invested and partially sold its shares, has risen significantly. SiTime supplies timing devices, essential components for electronic devices, and has become a popular stock due to the AI (Artificial Intelligence) boom. Although its shareholding ratio has gradually decreased, the rise in SiTime's stock price has, conversely, increased MegaChips' asset value, leading to an upward revision of its full-year net profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 at the end of November. This seems to be due to the ability to sell SiTime shares at a higher price than previously planned. In AI-related fields, as I mentioned last month, US tech giants are making ""astonishing"" amounts of capital investment, causing a supply-demand imbalance for many electronic components, including not only GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) but also DRAM, flash memory, and HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Already, even memory for DIY PCs is seeing sales restrictions in stores. I believe readers may not yet fully grasp this, but if massive investments in AI continue at this pace, there's an atmosphere suggesting a significant impact on the game sector next year. The ""PS5"" reportedly managed to procure components cheaply in 2024, leading to repeated price cuts, but the future is uncertain. ""Switch 2"" also uses more DRAM and flash memory than its predecessor ""Switch,"" and considering the impact of Trump tariffs, the price situation is becoming unclear. If the price of memory and other components for ""Switch 2"" continues to rise, increasing cost burdens, we must anticipate a situation where losses could increase with higher sales volumes in 2026. Especially in 2026, the second year of ""Switch 2,"" it is a time when Nintendo would want to significantly increase sales with appropriate measures. Nintendo will need to carefully consider pricing and procurement volumes. In Japan, demand is strong, and a slight price increase would likely be tolerated. There might also be situations where price increases need to be considered in conjunction with measures like new color variations. I used game consoles as an example, but I believe the AI boom is also significantly impacting the prices of smartphones and PCs. I have also tried generative AI, and while I can certainly understand its high performance from its outputs, on the other hand, I have the impression that monetization is not quite succeeding yet. Whether this boom can be turned into a genuine trend will be questioned from the latter half of 2026 onwards. ●Expectations for Kintetsu, energized by popular V-Tuber events. In the railway sector, I would like to highlight Kintetsu Group Holdings <9041>. Although there were no major surprises in the first-half earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025) itself, the Expo effect is expected to reach 25 billion yen, significantly exceeding the initial plan of 12.5 billion yen. While such strong performance raises concerns about the impact in the second half and beyond, as I reported last time, the third ""Seven-Dimensional Student Council"" event, centered around Suo Sango from Nijisanji (a popular V-Tuber group operated by ANYCOLOR <5032>), is being held at Shima Spain Village. I also visited Shima Spain Village recently, and despite it being a weekday, I saw many young people at Ugata Station, the closest station to Spain Village, which reaffirmed the high popularity of V-Tubers. Mie Kotsu (under Mie Kotsu Group Holdings <3232>) has significantly increased bus services to Shima Spain Village, creating an impression completely different from its previous quiet image. According to Kintetsu Group, initial visitors to this event significantly increased compared to the previous one, and it is deeply moving to see an era where a single piece of video content can bring about such a change in visitor numbers. Usage of their Ise-Shima Limited Express is also strong, so I am looking forward to its future prospects. By the way, in the railway sector, a decrease in inbound tourism due to the rapid deterioration of Japan-China relations is cited as a concern. Of course, future trends will need to be closely monitored, but I do not anticipate a significant decrease. This is because inbound tourism has diversified compared to its early days, and it is no longer solely reliant on Chinese travelers. Finally, I would like to mention JR Kyushu <9142> again. While I already discussed the second-quarter earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (July-September 2025) last time, ""Nintendo FUKUOKA,"" which opened at ""JR Hakata City"" in November, is generating significant excitement. On the opening day, people reportedly started lining up from 5 AM, and the limited-time sale of hot chocolate with a mug was also a great success. While issues such as confusion over ticket distribution and reselling were observed on social media, I believe these incidents reaffirmed its high popularity. Rather, the media coverage of these events may have contributed to increasing the national recognition of ""JR Hakata City."" Railway companies tend to focus on customers along their lines, but revenue from tenant sales is also a significant source of income. I believe that by attracting a wide range of people, including those from the Tokyo metropolitan area, in addition to local demand, further growth can be achieved. While the earnings of each company were generally good, looking at the overall market, I believe there is certainly a bias towards AI stocks in terms of stock prices at present. Whether that base expands will be the dividing line between a bubble or not. I will continue to track and report on the trends of each company.",Stock Search News,2025-12-11,Positive,Diverged,-1.0769902013129087,-4.33026106668931,Diverged,T+1,Medium,4100.0,-1.9607843137254901,3525.0,-0.7601351351351352,-1.2006491785903548,-0.19129603060736491,-1.7728797316722569,-1.3710128707330722,-0.7332802212933811,1.1330536919776222,0.3928767495599382,4181.0,1.975609756097561,3593.0,1.929078014184397,0.04653174191316389,0.0,1.975609756097561,0.9269662921348315,1.124665047238026,1.430045043093607,1.3668953605819034

When compared, operating profit is 2.6 times higher than the same period last year.

SMBC Nikko Securities expects the continued expansion of eFootball's popularity. The investment rating was maintained at '1 (Outperform)', and the target price was raised from 20,000 yen to 28,000 yen. SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast for the fiscal years ending March 2026 to March 2029 and raised its operating profit primarily due to the better-than-expected performance of 'eFootball'. As of the company's announcement on September 18, the title had surpassed 900 million cumulative downloads worldwide, demonstrating its global popularity across Japan, Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Africa. SMBC Nikko assumes that the 30th-anniversary event from July, the quality improvements such as operability in the major update in August, and the implementation of new features were well-received, leading to an increase in active users. The rising popularity of soccer leading up to the 'FIFA World Cup' to be held in June 2026 is also expected to be a tailwind. ★12:59 Maxvalu Tokai - Rebounds with 3.8% increase in same-store sales for November Maxvalu Tokai (8198) rebounded. The company announced at 12:30 PM on the 8th that its same-store sales for November, based on preliminary figures, increased by 3.8% year-on-year. Same-store customer numbers increased by 1.2%, and same-store customer spending per visit rose by 2.6%. Same-store comparisons are calculated year-on-year, adjusted for stores that have been open for 12 months after their opening month (excluding the half-year period in which they opened) and closed stores. ★13:03 CSP - Daiwa downgrades investment rating, active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market needed CSP (3086) saw a slight decline. Daiwa Securities pointed out the need for active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market. The investment rating was downgraded from '2 (Outperform)' to '3 (Neutral)', and the target price was raised from 3,100 yen to 3,160 yen. Daiwa believes that while an increase in demand due to price hikes and a perceived deterioration in public safety has been observed for the two major security companies, CSP has not fully benefited from it. It was noted that, at present, it is difficult to envision concrete strategies for expanding the customer base, excluding M&A. Operating profit forecasts are 4.55 billion yen for the fiscal year ending February 2026 and 4.44 billion yen for the fiscal year ending February 2027. It is believed that the second-half performance depends on the timing of revenue recognition for the Takanawa project, and there is a possibility of it being heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. Furthermore, it was explained that active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market are required. ★13:06 SKY Perfect JSAT - Turns positive in afternoon session, signs launch contract for next-generation satellites with U.S. SpaceX SKY Perfect JSAT Holdings (9412) turned positive in the afternoon session. The company announced at 1:00 PM on the 8th that its wholly-owned subsidiary, SKY Perfect JSAT, has selected U.S. SpaceX as a partner and signed a contract for the launch services (rocket procurement and satellite launch transportation services) of communication satellites 'JSAT-31' and 'JSAT-32'. The three next-generation satellites, including 'Superbird-9' for which a contract has already been signed, are scheduled to be launched sequentially starting in 2027. ★13:13 Toyota Motor - Mizuho raises target price, strong sense of undervaluation when looking at next fiscal year's performance Toyota Motor (7203) rebounded. Mizuho Securities pointed out a strong sense of undervaluation when looking at next fiscal year's performance. The investment rating was maintained at 'Buy', and the target price was raised from 3,400 yen to 3,700 yen. Mizuho believes that the strength in sales, particularly in the U.S., remains intact, and with the introduction of the new RAV4 and the full HEV conversion of the RAV4, robust sales trends are expected to continue. Furthermore, in the interim financial results, the company indicated its intention to once again work on improving the break-even point in terms of units, so in addition to sales, trends in costs will also be noteworthy going forward. In addition, an increase in EPS is expected next fiscal year due to a share buyback from Toyota Industries Corporation. Considering these factors, the current stock price is seen as significantly undervalued when anticipating a recovery in next fiscal year's performance. ★13:15 Mitsubishi Electric - SMBC Nikko raises target price, expects continued momentum in capital efficiency improvement Mitsubishi Electric (6503) rebounded. SMBC Nikko Securities judged that the momentum for improving capital efficiency can be expected to continue. The investment rating was maintained at '1 (Outperform)', and the target price was raised from 4,100 yen to 4,600 yen. SMBC Nikko assumes that the momentum for improving capital efficiency will continue through growth centered on infrastructure (defense, DC UPS, power infrastructure), business restructuring, fixed cost reduction measures, and a commitment to strengthening shareholder returns. It is believed that the capital market's expectations will rise to a higher level. While the operating profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 was reduced, it was increased for the fiscal year ending March 2027. The effect of an annual 20 billion yen reduction in fixed costs from the fiscal year ending March 2027 onwards was reflected.",Traders Web,2025-12-08,Positive,Aligned,2.3380467679847303,-0.9661024015296652,Aligned,T+1,Strong,3060.0,0.9234828496042217,3550.0,0.7950028392958546,0.1284800103083671,0.5936675461741424,0.32786885245901637,0.39592760180995473,0.0,0.853359987928256,-0.6101406839858459,3066.0,0.19607843137254902,3548.0,-0.056338028169014086,0.2524164595415631,0.522875816993464,-0.3250975292587776,-0.16882386043894204,0.19338804878396507,0.8357856525134917,-0.6900937590110834

Amid lingering concerns about a Taiwan contingency involving China, Chinese military fighter jets illuminated Japan Self-Defense Forces fighter jets with radar on the 6th, indicating increasing pressure on Japan from the Chinese side. In this context, US Secretary of Defense Hegges's speech on the 6th, in which he called for allies such as Japan to introduce a target of raising defense spending to 5% of GDP within a few years, stimulated the stock prices of defense-related companies. As many defense-related stocks, including Mitsubishi Heavy, had undergone significant adjustments in the November market, buying based on a sense of value has become easier in the short term. ■Nishimatsu Construction <1820> 5,781 yen +168 yen (+3.0%) Today's closing price.

SKY Perfect JSAT Holdings <9412> renewed its year-to-date high for consecutive days. Around 1:00 PM on the 8th, the company announced that its subsidiary had signed a launch contract with US SpaceX for two next-generation communication satellites.

According to the Nikkei Shimbun morning edition dated the 6th, the company has developed a small-scale data center where components are produced in a factory and assembled on-site. According to the article, the construction period can be significantly shortened from the typical 5 years for a building-type to 1 year. As demand for data center construction increases with the spread of generative AI, the company expects demand mainly in regional areas and aims to contribute to the decentralization of data centers currently concentrated in the Tokyo metropolitan area and Kansai region. ★9:51 Komatsu - SMBC Nikko downgrades investment rating; Monitoring price pass-through trends Komatsu <6301> continued to fall. SMBC Nikko Securities is monitoring price pass-through trends. The investment rating was downgraded from '1 (Outperform)' to '2 (Neutral)', and the target stock price was lowered from 6,000 yen to 5,000 yen. SMBC Nikko believes that while the company's robust shareholder returns will continue to support the stock price, it is difficult to factor in expectations for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to two points: the anticipated slowdown in demand in highly profitable Indonesia, and strong uncertainty regarding the price pass-through policy in response to US tariff impacts. Future catalysts are expected to be the elimination of these uncertainties. In the medium to long term, attention is focused on expanding market share in North America and increasing performance in underground mining machinery. ★9:51 Nagase & Co. - Daiwa raises target stock price; Focus on high competitive advantage in encapsulating materials for advanced semiconductors, etc. Nagase & Co. <8012> remained firm. Daiwa Securities is focusing on the high competitive advantage in encapsulating materials for advanced semiconductors, among other factors. The investment rating was maintained at '2 (Outperform)', and the target stock price was raised from 4,000 yen to 4,900 yen. Daiwa forecasts operating profit of 42.0 billion yen for FY26/3 (previous 42.0 billion yen, company plan 40.7 billion yen), 45.0 billion yen for FY27/3 (previous 45.0 billion yen), and 47.0 billion yen for FY28/3 (previous 47.0 billion yen). Since the company has not yet decided on the total shareholder return ratio target for FY27/3 and beyond, Daiwa conservatively assumes it, but believes there is significant upside potential in reality. Key points of focus include: (1) strong undervaluation based on total shareholder return yield within the trading company sector, (2) proactive stance towards improving shareholder returns, (3) adoption of a continuous dividend increase policy, and (4) high competitive advantage in encapsulating materials for advanced semiconductors, which are expected to see high growth in the medium to long term within the semiconductor market. ★10:01 Mitsui & Co. - Rebounds; New LNG production in Australia for the first time in 5 years; 10% increase in global equity = Nikkei Mitsui & Co. <8031> rebounded. According to the Nikkei Shimbun morning edition dated the 8th, the company will begin new production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Australia within 2025. According to the article, this LNG will originate from gas fields in Western Australia, with production expected to be around 700,000 tons per year on an equity basis. This marks the first new LNG production at a company in which Mitsui & Co. has an investment in 5 years. If fully operational, the company's equity share of LNG production is expected to increase by a simple calculation of 10% from current levels to approximately 6.7 million tons per year. ★10:10 Takeuchi Mfg. - SMBC Nikko downgrades investment rating; Overvalued given the risk of sluggish performance in FY27/2 Takeuchi Mfg. <6432> plunged. SMBC Nikko Securities judged the stock price to be overvalued given the risk of sluggish performance in the fiscal year ending February 2027. The investment rating was downgraded from '2 (Neutral)' to '3 (Underperform)', and the target stock price was raised from 4,600 yen to 5,000 yen. SMBC Nikko expects the full-year plan to be missed given the current housing market environment. Furthermore, for FY27/2, a significant decline in profit is anticipated due to a decrease in sales volume resulting from the peaking out of order backlogs and the impact of US tariffs. Amidst this, the P/E ratio based on the estimated EPS for FY27/2 is approximately 16x, which is the highest level in the past 10 years, leading to a perception of overvaluation and a judgment that there is significant downside risk for the stock price. The catalyst is considered to be the announcement of the company's plan for FY27/2. ★10:15 Enomoto - Substantially continues to rise; fundnote increases its stake in the company; Holding ratio increases from 7.66% to 9.93% Enomoto <6928> substantially continued to rise.

However, the company possesses world-class rare earth refining technology, which could elevate its recognition as a key company in terms of national policy. Hirata Corp. <6258> = Strong upward momentum, new high. After the close of trading on the 3rd, the company announced that it will start inspection services for products containing cannabis-derived ingredients (CBD-containing products) from February 2026. CBD, a cannabis-derived ingredient, is expected to offer various health benefits such as relaxation, better sleep, and pain relief. Its safety has been confirmed by the World Health Organization, leading to a global expansion of the related market. Although market expansion is also expected domestically, manufacturers of CBD-containing products are legally obligated to inspect for residual narcotic components, and the company appears to aim to capture this demand. It seems to be bought on this news. Nihon Kohden <6849> = Sharp rebound, signaling a recovery. Rebounding significantly for the first time in six days. It opened with a gap up and jumped over the 5-day moving average, creating an impression of a bottoming-out and reversal. As a specialized manufacturer of medical electronic equipment, it has high product competitiveness and boasts a top share in products such as electroencephalographs (EEGs). For the fiscal year ending March 2026, sales are expected to reach a new record high for consecutive periods, and operating profit is also projected to see double-digit growth, indicating strong performance. Amidst this, the company announced on the 3rd the establishment of a share buyback program. The program allows for the acquisition of up to 3.8 million shares, equivalent to 2.33% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury stock), or up to 5 billion yen in value, with the acquisition period extending until the end of March next year (a portion of which was acquired in off-hours trading this morning). This attracted buying interest, anticipating an improvement in the supply-demand balance of the shares. TOWA <6315> = Continued rise. At one point, it surged by 6.7%. In the medium term, it continues an upward trend with the 26-week moving average acting as a support line. Leveraging its high technological capabilities cultivated through ultra-precision molds, it boasts world-leading product competitiveness in semiconductor resin encapsulation equipment (molding equipment). While Nvidia <NVDA> stock has been somewhat lackluster in the US stock market recently, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, has shown strong upward momentum, forming bullish candlesticks for eight consecutive days until the previous day. The company's compression equipment for HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), which is installed with GPUs for AI servers, is capturing high demand, and this is expected to drive double-digit operating profit growth this fiscal year. The 2,000 yen level has served as the lower bound of a two-and-a-half-month trading range for the stock price, and buying activity is currently observed, anticipating a rebound. Blue Innovation <5597> = Significant continued rise. After the close of trading on the 3rd, the company announced that it had signed a brand license agreement with AeroProbing, a Taiwanese drone manufacturer, which is viewed as positive news. The aim of this agreement is to build a cooperative framework for creating new value in the Asian market by mutually leveraging the technological capabilities and business experience that both companies have cultivated. Based on this, Blue Innovation will commence full-scale expansion into the Asian market from January 2026.",Minkabu,2025-12-04,Positive,Diverged,-1.1739014911836316,0.936782970942876,Diverged,T+1,Medium,4868.0,3.928266438941076,3566.0,2.002288329519451,1.9259781094216253,0.25619128949615716,3.6626916524701874,1.8566123964581547,2.8750188793882088,1.2952629131089308,0.8399855056198329,4808.0,-1.2325390304026294,3522.0,-1.233875490745934,0.0013364603433045907,-2.115858668857847,0.9024134312696747,-0.17006802721088435,-0.9396654661948048,1.0565816861945119,0.17520074470115266

Technically, it has broken out of a mid-range consolidation with the appearance of a large bullish candlestick, suggesting the initial phase of a major two-stage rally. Amid prominent buybacks in semiconductor-related stocks in the U.S., there are voices saying, ""Investment funds have started to focus on the semiconductor-related materials sector (chemical stocks) in the Tokyo market, which has been lagging"" (according to a mid-tier securities strategist). In this context, the company, as the world's top manufacturer of semiconductor silicon wafers, is experiencing strong tailwinds. The company is also one of Japan's leading players in photoresists, used to form semiconductor circuits, and is highly regarded by overseas investors. Furthermore, triggered by China's export restrictions on rare earths due to political reasons, speculative price movements have been observed in related stocks in this field. However, the company possesses world-class rare earth refining technology, which could elevate its recognition as a key company in terms of national policy. ■KeePer Giken Co., Ltd. <6036> 3,565 yen +115 yen (+3.3%) Closing Price Today KeePer Giken Co., Ltd. <6036> rebounded for the first time in three days.

On this day, it was announced that its U.S. consolidated subsidiary, Clean Energy & Industrial Gases Group (CE&IG Group), had secured an order for an Air Separation Unit (ASU) to be constructed by Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Nippon Sanso Holdings <4091>, in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was viewed as positive news. The new plant will produce oxygen, nitrogen, and argon and is being built to meet the increasing demand for liquefied gases in the medical, manufacturing, construction, and food processing industries in Nevada, California, Utah, and Arizona, with completion scheduled for 2027. Furthermore, the CE&IG Group plans to procure liquid nitrogen from this plant and use it for performance testing of cryogenic pumps (special pumps that handle extremely low-temperature liquids) conducted at its own pump manufacturing facility in Las Vegas before installation and deployment. ■TWOSTONE & Sons Inc. <7352> 769 yen +22 yen (+3.0%) Closing Price Today TWOSTONE & Sons Inc. <7352> continued its significant rally. Before the market opened on this day, it was announced that ""Midworks,"" a matching service for freelance engineers and companies operated by its subsidiary Branding Engineer, had been adopted by Smartscape (Minato-ku, Tokyo), leading to buying activity in response to this positive news.

In recent years, projects requiring more specialized and advanced skills have increased, and there is a demand for speed in response.

Its subsidiary, Nissin Foods, announced on the 3rd that it would raise the prices of instant bagged noodles, instant cup noodles, and instant cup soups for shipments starting April 1, 2026. Improved profitability is expected as a result. Amid continued soaring prices for main raw materials and packaging materials, and rising logistics costs, the company determined that it would be difficult to absorb the increased costs through self-help efforts alone. The revised prices will result in a 5-11% increase in the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Additionally, the company plans to change the content volume of some instant bagged noodles and instant cup rice, reducing it by 7-17% for products re-released on April 6 next year. ■INPEX Corporation <1605> 3,210 yen +77 yen (+2.5%) Closing Price Today INPEX Corporation <1605> rebounded for the first time in four days. On the 3rd, U.S. crude oil futures for January delivery (WTI - West Texas Intermediate) rose by $0.31 from the previous day to $58.95 per barrel. No significant progress was observed in the discussions for a ceasefire in Ukraine between Russian President Putin and U.S. Special Envoy for the Middle East Witkoff on the 2nd, leading to a decline in expectations for easing Western sanctions against Russia. As crude oil prices rose, INPEX saw a buying-dominant trend. ■Kurita Water Industries Ltd. <6370> 6,515 yen +154 yen (+2.4%) Closing Price Today Kurita Water Industries Ltd. <6370> continued its rally.

The aim of this partnership is to further strengthen the relationship between the two companies towards realizing lunar water resource development and to further concretize future plans that are being jointly considered. Specifically, they will collaborate on formulating business models and strategies for securing and supplying lunar water resources, evaluating payload development and technological demonstrations necessary for lunar water utilization technology, and joint planning for lunar demonstrations using ispace landers. ■TOWA Corporation <6315> 2,170 yen +50 yen (+2.4%) Closing Price Today TOWA Corporation <6315> continued its rally, soaring by 6.7% at one point. In the medium term, it continues an upward trend with the 26-week moving average as a support line. Leveraging its high technical capabilities cultivated through ultra-precision molds, it boasts world-leading product competitiveness in semiconductor resin molding equipment (molding machines). While Nvidia's stock price has been lackluster in the U.S. stock market recently, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, has shown strong upward momentum, forming bullish candlesticks for eight consecutive days until the previous day. The company's compression equipment for HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), which is installed with GPUs for AI servers, is capturing high demand, and this is expected to drive a double-digit operating profit increase this fiscal year. The 2,000 yen mark has been the lower bound of a two-and-a-half-month box range for the stock price, and buying activity is currently observed, anticipating a rebound. ■Park24 Co., Ltd. <4666> 1,868.5 yen +40.5 yen (+2.2%) Closing Price Today Park24 Co., Ltd. <4666> rebounded for the first time in five days.

In addition to an estimated positive impact of approximately 3.1% on existing store sales due to two more holidays compared to the previous year, sales of knitwear and outerwear were strong due to generally low temperatures nationwide. Furthermore, Onward Personal Style, which operates the custom-made brand ""KASHIYAMA,"" saw its lifestyle-proposal new business format store ""Kashiyama"" continue to perform well, with a significant increase in new customers.

Nissan Chemical <4021> continued to rise. SMBC Nikko Securities expects growth driven by both semiconductor materials and agrochemicals. The investment rating was maintained at ""1 (Outperform),"" and the target price was raised from 6,300 yen to 6,500 yen. SMBC Nikko judged that the company's plan was revised upward, mainly for agrochemicals and semiconductor materials, in the Q2 financial results for the fiscal year ending March 2026, increasing the certainty of achieving record-high profits. In particular, the strong performance of semiconductor materials, led by advanced semiconductors, was notable, and the firm expects growth to continue to outpace the shipment area of silicon wafers. Furthermore, the new herbicide Verder, launched in the fiscal year ending March 2025, grew more than expected, reaffirming the company's strong new product development capabilities. For the fiscal year ending March 2027, while a decrease in revenue from the animal drug active ingredient fluralaner is likely to be a drag, SMBC Nikko expects the profit growth trend to continue, primarily driven by semiconductor materials and agrochemicals. The current low valuation metrics are believed to underestimate the company's R&D capabilities.★9:53 Rengo - SMBC Nikko raises target price, a phase where changes in awareness regarding capital policy begin to be factored in. Rengo <3941> rebounded for the first time in three days. SMBC Nikko Securities judged this to be a phase where changes in awareness regarding capital policy begin to be factored in. The investment rating was maintained at ""1 (Outperform),"" and the target price was raised from 1,070 yen to 1,300 yen. SMBC Nikko expects that for the fiscal year ending March 2026, due to delays in the recovery of domestic corrugated board demand and European heavy packaging materials, the second half's performance will fall below the company's plan as anticipated. On the other hand, the firm noted the emergence of new positive factors, such as improved performance of RM Higashi Cello, which was newly consolidated from the previous fiscal year in the flexible packaging sector, and the proactive capital policy, including an upward revision of the full-year dividend forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026. Considering that corrugated board price increases are expected to contribute to performance in the fiscal year ending March 2027, SMBC Nikko believes there is still room for a reevaluation of the stock price.★10:02 &ST - Fourth consecutive day of decline; Adastria's existing store sales up 1.2% in November, growth decelerates month-on-month. &ST HD <2685> fell for the fourth consecutive day.

Total store sales increased by 4.3% year-on-year, a 3.3 percentage point decrease compared to the previous month.★10:04 Shiseido - SMBC Nikko lowers target price, concerns about worsening Japan-China relations remain. Shiseido <4911> fell for the third consecutive day. SMBC Nikko Securities pointed out that while the impairment loss in the Americas might suggest that all negative factors have been priced in, concerns about worsening Japan-China relations remain. The investment rating was maintained at ""2 (Neutral),"" and the target price was raised from 2,660 yen to 2,600 yen. SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast and target price based on the Q3 results for the fiscal year ending December 2025 and the new medium-term management plan. The firm commented that the new medium-term plan's growth strategy is unclear, and the impression that challenges remain in expanding global market share could not be dispelled. In the short term, attention is focused on whether flagship brands SHISEIDO and NARS can secure a growth trajectory that surpasses the European and American markets, and whether the fragrance portfolio can be further expanded with the launch of MaxMara. SMBC Nikko also pointed out that strengthening brands in the globally growing medical & derma sector is a challenge, and with high exposure to profits from China, concerns about boycotts stemming from worsening Japan-China relations are expected to weigh on stock price recovery in the short term.★10:10 Liberaware - Continued decline; Launches ""Torinos"" automated patrol camera. Liberaware <218A> continued to fall. The company announced on the 3rd that it would begin selling ""Torinos,"" an automated patrol camera that provides equipment maintenance DX, starting the same day. This product was developed with the aim of transforming patrol inspection operations in vast facilities. A camera unit traveling on rails remotely and automatically patrols within facilities, performing photography and recording, thereby significantly streamlining conventional manual inspections. This will enable the provision of equipment maintenance DX, starting with patrol inspections, for facilities such as large data centers, plants, tunnels, dam inspection galleries, and other tunnels. The positive impact on the stock price has been limited.★10:23 Ohsho Food - Trading sideways; November directly-managed existing store sales up 6%. Ohsho Food Service <9936> traded sideways.

Significant rebound. Announced a collaboration with SoftBank for the practical application of AI robots. By combining the company's AI robot technology with SoftBank's information processing technology, robots will be able to perform autonomous tasks safely even in environments with many unspecified people, such as office buildings.

Announced plans to take the company private through an MBO. JG35, an asset management company of the founding family, which plans to invest, will conduct a Tender Offer (TOB) at 2,315 yen per share. The TOB price represents a 6.0% premium over the previous day's closing price, leading to a movement towards the TOB price. The TOB period is scheduled from the 2nd until January 20, 2026. Amid intensifying competition due to the increase in low-cost gyms, the company reportedly plans to accelerate new store openings by going private. < 3407 > Asahi Kasei 1272 +25. Significant rebound. Announced an agreement with Teijin to integrate their respective textile trading subsidiaries in October 2026. Teijin Frontier and Asahi Kasei Advance will merge, with Teijin Frontier as the surviving company. After the merger, Teijin will hold an 80% stake and Asahi Kasei will hold 20%. This development is expected to bring benefits such as economies of scale, and for Asahi Kasei, it will also enable the concentration of management resources into high-profit businesses like healthcare. Buying activity is leading for both companies, and for Asahi Kasei, there is also a rebound effect from the sharp decline towards the close of the previous day. < 4665 > Duskin 4258 +266. Significant rebound. Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities upgraded its investment rating from ""Underweight"" to ""Equal-weight"" and raised its target price from 2,800 yen to 4,300 yen. It pointed out that the increasing proportion of the food business, centered on Mister Donut, makes it easier to consider restaurant valuations, and it appears they have changed the applicable valuation metric from PBR to PER. Furthermore, reflecting the strong performance of existing Mister Donut stores, the company has also revised its earnings forecast upward. < 8306 > Mitsubishi UFJ 2523.5 +60.5. Significant continued rise. The banking sector is the second-highest gainer by industry today, continuing its upward trend. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda stated at a press conference the previous day that even with an interest rate hike, ""the situation is still accommodative,"" and expressed his intention to ""appropriately judge the necessity of an interest rate hike"" at the Monetary Policy Meeting to be held on the 18th-19th. In response, an additional interest rate hike at the December meeting is now strongly priced in. The yield on 10-year government bonds, a benchmark for long-term interest rates, temporarily rose to 1.880%, reaching its highest level in approximately 17 and a half years. < 7564 > Workman 6720 -260. Significant continued decline. Announced its monthly trends for November the previous day. Existing store sales increased by 7.9% year-on-year, a deceleration from the 19.5% increase in the previous month. Since the last monthly announcement, the stock price had been on an upward trend, so selling to close positions seems to be dominant due to the slowdown in the sales growth rate. The number of customers increased by 5.3%, and the average customer spend also rose by 2.5%, but both figures represent a slowdown compared to the previous month's growth. It appears that colder temperatures supported sales of winter clothing. < 2678 > Askul 1391 -32. Significant continued decline. Announced the postponement of its first-half financial results disclosure, which was scheduled for December 15. This is due to the suspension of orders on its e-commerce site following a cyberattack, and the time required to calculate the extent of the damage. The company also announced its monthly trends for November, with sales significantly down by 95% year-on-year, and a sharp decline in its consumer-向け ""LOHACO"" business. While this was somewhat anticipated, limiting the surprise, there is currently no clear timeline for the full recovery of LOHACO, which is being viewed as a negative factor. < 2593 > Ito En 3053 -120. Significant continued decline. Announced its first-half financial results the previous day, with operating profit at 13.9 billion yen, a 3.2% decrease year-on-year. This marks a shift from a 17.3% increase in the first quarter to a decline in profit, and market expectations are believed to have been missed by approximately 2 billion yen. There is also a view that the hurdle for achieving the unchanged full-year plan of 25.5 billion yen, an 11.0% increase from the previous fiscal year, has risen. The background is the deterioration in profitability of domestic beverages, where the impact of higher raw material and ingredient costs is significant, and the effect of price increases appears to be limited. < 3465 > KEIICHI STAR 6290 +230. Significant continued rise. SMBC Nikko Securities upgraded its investment rating from ""2"" to ""1"" and raised its target price from 5,500 yen to 7,300 yen. It believes there is a possibility of an upward revision being announced when the third-quarter financial results are released, and strong guidance can be expected for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to an increase in the number of condominium units sold.

The investment rating remains ""Buy,"" and the target price has been raised from 2,100 yen to 2,400 yen. Nomura revised its earnings forecast based on the July-September quarter results. This revision incorporates 1) a revision of foreign exchange assumptions, 2) the positive impact of IRA restructuring, 3) Vyloy's market penetration exceeding expectations, and 4) efficient business restructuring. It was pointed out that currently, in addition to significant growth in new drugs, there are many positive factors boosting performance, such as the positive impact of IRA restructuring and the weak erosion by generics due to court rulings.

★10:02 Suzuki - Trading flat; Fair Trade Commission reportedly plans to recommend against its subsidiary for Subcontract Act violation
Suzuki <7269> traded flat. The Nikkei Shimbun Digital Edition reported at 2:00 on the 2nd that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has decided to recommend that Suzuki's wholly-owned subsidiary, Snic, take measures to prevent recurrence, on the grounds that setting significantly low order prices for parts of automobiles whose mass production has ended constitutes a violation of the Subcontract Act (unjustly low pricing). According to the article, this was learned through interviews with related parties. It is said to be the first time that a violation of the Subcontract Act has been recognized regarding order prices for replacement parts, and each manufacturer may be forced to rationalize their transactions.
★10:07 NRI - Nomura raises target price; expects continued domestic profit growth, overseas operations to turn profitable through structural reforms
Nomura Research Institute <4307> continued to rise. Nomura Securities expects continued domestic profit growth and overseas operations to turn profitable through structural reforms. The investment rating remains ""Buy,"" and the target price has been raised from 6,800 yen to 7,700 yen. Nomura expects sales growth driven by domestic DX demand, in addition to improved profitability through the utilization of AI. Domestically, they anticipate steady business expansion in consulting and financial SaaS businesses, as well as a recovery in sales in industrial IT, where sales growth had been slowing due to investment restraint from large clients, high growth in security-related areas with strong demand, and improved profitability through AI utilization, primarily in financial IT. For the fiscal year ending March 2027, they forecast a 15% increase in operating profit year-on-year, driven by improved profitability through AI utilization, increased revenue in each business segment, and profit improvement due to the reduction of structural reform costs overseas and cost control.

Mizuho believes that, going forward, in addition to improving profitability through further price revisions, mainly for mechanical security, the company is in a phase where capital efficiency improvements, such as share buybacks utilizing its surplus assets, can be expected towards achieving its medium-term target of 10% ROE for the fiscal year ending March 2028. If shareholder returns are strengthened to achieve 10% ROE for the fiscal year ending March 2028, the stock may appear more undervalued compared to past PER levels. ★13:13 AGC - SMBC Nikko raises target price; Continues to await growth recovery in strategic businesses AGC <5201> fell for the first time in 7 days. SMBC Nikko Securities stated that it continues to await the growth recovery of strategic businesses, maintaining its investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raising its target price from 4,200 yen to 4,300 yen. SMBC Nikko revised the applicable PER from 10.6x to 10.4x, reflecting changes in earnings contribution and multiples for each business. While the automotive segment reflected improved profitability due to the company's profit-focused stance, the chemicals segment reflected the stagnation of caustic soda and PVC markets in Southeast Asia. Towards the fiscal year ending December 2026, the withdrawal from the large tank business in life sciences and increased capacity in chemicals in Southeast Asia are expected to contribute to performance, but the focus will be on whether growth recovery can be seen in electronics, such as optoelectronics and EUV mask blanks.

Lines <9104> rebounded for the first time in three days. Bloomberg reported at 11:00 on the 28th that the company is considering introducing a progressive dividend policy in its next medium-term management plan, which would maintain or increase dividends. According to the article, the aim appears to be to enhance dividend stability in the shipping industry, which experiences significant earnings fluctuations, and to attract long-term investors. The company's President, Takeshi Hashimoto, reportedly stated in an interview that during Phase 2 of the management plan, which begins next fiscal year (ending March 2027), ""we will fundamentally aim for a progressive dividend model.""
★14:52 FANUC - SMBC Nikko raises target price; Lacks further equity story. FANUC <6954> rose for the fourth consecutive day. SMBC Nikko Securities pointed out that there is a lack of further equity story. They maintained their investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised their target price from 4,400 yen to 5,300 yen. SMBC Nikko views the order intake plan for the second half of the fiscal year as somewhat conservative and expects full-year earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 to exceed forecasts. Additionally, they believe that operating profit growth is possible for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to improved demand accompanying lower US interest rates. On the other hand, they noted that momentum in automotive demand, a key customer for the company, is difficult to anticipate, and it is currently hard to find an equity story beyond an increase in sales volume, thus lacking further positive catalysts. While they stated that the stock price could rise strongly if a robust demand recovery due to the return of manufacturing to the US is confirmed, they are primarily looking forward to the disclosure of a medium-term management plan and ROE targets to identify an equity story.

This insurance compensates operating businesses for lost operating profit from canceled reservations and bear countermeasures expenses if a tourist or leisure facility is closed due to a bear incursion onto its premises. The product was reportedly developed in response to the growing financial burden associated with facility closures and safety measures due to bear incursions.

Mizuho revised its earnings forecast based on the briefing and additional interviews after the Q2 FY26/3 earnings announcement. It pointed out that the Q2 results provided a sense of relief, with actual business profit (BP) excluding special cacao factors increasing by 29% (3 billion yen) year-on-year, and BP including these special factors turning profitable (9.7 billion yen) from a loss (1.7 billion yen) in the same period last year. In the food sector's July-September results, overall performance stagnated due to increased consumer awareness of cost-saving, but some companies securing ""down-trade"" demand performed well.

The investment rating is maintained at ""Buy,"" and the target price has been raised from 4,550 yen to 5,750 yen. Marusan revised its forecast upward based on earnings trends. While order intake and sales are strong, it particularly reflects a significant increase in profit margins. In addition to core indoor wiring and environmental equipment construction, power infrastructure-related works such as distribution line construction and engineering-related works continue to perform well. The company expects solid earnings growth under a favorable business environment, backed by robust construction and power infrastructure investments.

The investment rating is maintained at ""Buy,"" and the target price has been raised from 2,300 yen to 2,700 yen. Mizuho is paying attention to the medium-term management plan scheduled for release next spring. It is watching for specific initiatives to correct the long-standing issue of low ROE (such as selling/withdrawing from unprofitable businesses, pursuing optimal capital structure utilizing share buybacks), setting an ROE target of 8%, and adopting a dividend policy not influenced by short-term performance (specifically, progressive dividends, DOE, etc.). While not significantly revising earnings forecasts, Mizuho has incorporated the expectation of such changes as a premium factor in its PBR valuation. ★13:10 Mobcast HD - Rebounds for the first time in 4 days, officially selected as a Solana Foundation official validator for ""SFDP"".

With this selection, the company will be able to receive SOL delegation from the Solana Foundation, significantly expanding opportunities to earn staking rewards beyond its own holdings. Starting from this selection, the company states that it will proceed with efforts to build a stable revenue base that is less susceptible to market conditions. ★13:14 Panasonic - Mizuho raises target price, current stock price undervalued in terms of both PBR and PER. Panasonic Holdings <6752> continued its significant rise. Mizuho Securities commented that the current stock price is undervalued in terms of both PBR and PER. The investment rating is maintained at ""Buy,"" and the target price has been raised from 2,400 yen to 2,540 yen. Mizuho sees a strong sense of undervaluation and significant upside potential for the stock price. It pointed out that while the Q2 results did not fully ""exhaust bad news,"" CEO Kusumi's renewed commitment to achieving 600 billion yen in adjusted operating profit next fiscal year and the spin-off of the housing business are significant positives. Expectations are high for the disclosure of BBU business strategy at the business briefing on December 2. Mizuho believes that expectations will build towards the announcement of next fiscal year's plan and new medium-term management plan in May. For the current fiscal year, a slight upward revision is expected, with avionics, electronic components, and BBU compensating for the downside in automotive batteries, though it is still expected to fall slightly short of the company's plan. For FY27/3, a significant increase in profit compared to the current year's forecast is expected.

SMBC Nikko judged that its competitive advantage has not been undermined. It maintained its investment rating at ""1 (Outperform)"" and raised its target price from 5,900 yen to 6,000 yen. SMBC Nikko believes that there are still no signs of improvement in the U.S. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) market, making a short-term recovery difficult to expect. On the other hand, it assumes that improvement is highly likely from 2027 onwards due to the U.S. housing market returning to a growth trajectory. Regarding semiconductor materials, it judged that demand related to AI is increasingly likely to grow at a faster pace than previously expected. Considering the difference in profit margins with competitors, it believes that its competitive advantage in its core businesses has not been undermined, and taking into account the undervaluation of its valuation metrics, there is significant upside potential when an improvement in the external environment is factored in. Kyowa Electric extended its rally for a fifth consecutive day. The company announced on the 25th that it would cancel 1,814,800 shares of its own stock. The scheduled cancellation date is December 15. The ratio to the total number of outstanding shares before cancellation will be 6.53%. Ono Pharmaceutical reached a new high. SMBC Nikko is focusing on the overseas sales trends of Opdivo subcutaneous injection and the progress of early-stage development products. It maintained its investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised its target price from 1,600 yen to 1,900 yen. SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast based on the Q2 FY26.3 earnings announcement and subsequent interviews. The company's three pillars for addressing the Opdivo cliff are mitigating sales decline through Opdivo subcutaneous injection, growth of Deciphera products, and growth of in-house developed products. Among these, the current revision incorporates the successful Phase 2 trial of the next-generation immunotherapy ""ONO-4578"" for gastric cancer and the successful Phase 2 trial of the multiple system atrophy treatment ""ONO-2808"" in relation to the growth of in-house developed products. Cringle Pharma continued its rally, interspersed with unchanged prices. The company announced on the 26th at 10:30 AM that patient enrollment has reached the target number of cases (62 cases) in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial (placebo-controlled, double-blind comparative study) administering recombinant human HGF protein preparation (KP-100LI) to patients with vocal cord scarring. The completion of this trial and the announcement of top-line data are expected in 2027. The company stated that it would proceed with the trial manufacturing of commercial formulations required for the application, with a view to subsequent manufacturing and marketing approval applications. Tokyo Tatemono extended its rally for a fourth consecutive day, interspersed with unchanged prices. SMBC Nikko Securities expects an upward revision of its medium-term management plan targets. It maintained its investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised its target price from 3,200 yen to 3,700 yen. SMBC Nikko raised its earnings forecast and target price based on the Q3 FY25.12 earnings announcement and the upward revision of the full-year company plan. It evaluated that the company's rental, income-generating real estate, and condominium sales businesses are progressing more favorably than expected, with accelerating increases in office rents and real estate prices against the backdrop of inflation. It believes that the likelihood of an upside deviation from the medium-term plan announced in January this year has increased.

""High-dividend stocks"" with high dividend yields are very popular. The basic strategy for high-dividend stocks is to hold them long-term and continue to receive dividends. Therefore, large-cap stocks with stable performance and a low risk of easily eliminating or reducing dividends provide peace of mind. Here, we will introduce two ""high-dividend stocks with a market capitalization of approximately 1 trillion yen or more and a dividend yield of 3% or more"" recommended by Kosuke Nishimura of Quant Research (※Stock prices and dividend yield data are as of November 4, 2025). The first one to be introduced is Toyota Motor Corporation (7203), with a market capitalization of 49,833.2 billion yen and a dividend yield of 3.0%. Toyota Motor Corporation is a world-leading automobile manufacturer, as is well known. Although the current fiscal year's earnings forecast anticipated a decrease in profit due to Trump tariffs, the company announced an upward revision for both sales and profit on November 5. The expected decline in profit is now projected to narrow. Automobile sales performance globally, including North America and China, is strong. The exchange rate is also trending weaker than the assumed 1 dollar = 146 yen, which is a factor boosting profits. The stock price feels like a laggard among major companies, and considering its brand power, the value of being a winner, and a dividend yield in the 3% range, it is rather considered a good buying opportunity. Next to be introduced is Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316), with a market capitalization of 16,082 billion yen and a dividend yield of 3.2%. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group centers around Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and SMBC Nikko Securities. Increased lending revenue and strong asset management are contributing to continuous record-high profits. Rising interest rates are also a tailwind. It is leading with ""Olive"" in mobile comprehensive financial services. While the stock price is near its all-time high with planned dividend increases for five consecutive periods, a PER of around 12 times does not suggest it is overvalued.

The company plans to invest 1 billion yen in equipment at its Miyagi factory, aiming to increase sales by approximately 28 times in fiscal year 2026 compared to fiscal year 2024. President Komata stated, 'We will strengthen existing lines to secure three times the current production capacity.

SUMCO <3436> saw a sharp rebound after three days. SMBC Nikko Securities expects a short-term sense of all bad news being priced in and mid-term acceleration of growth due to AI. The investment rating remains '1 (Outperform),' and the target price has been raised from 1,500 yen to 1,600 yen. SMBC Nikko believes that in Q1 of the December 2026 fiscal year, the deficit is highly likely to shrink significantly, also due to a quarter-on-quarter decrease in depreciation expenses. Regarding depreciation expenses, the breakdown of construction in progress and the depreciation method for Formosa SUMCO Technology should also be considered. On the other hand, demand related to AI is judged to be increasing at a faster pace than previously expected. Considering the short-term sense of all bad news being priced in and the improvement in the mid-term outlook, it is considered a good opportunity for dip buying. ★10:17 Ibiden - MSMUFG downgrades investment rating; further upside potential for stock price is limited.

For its main product, FC package substrates for semiconductors, it estimates that the FC packages for NVIDIA's Blackwell, which the company began mass shipping from July-September 2024, have an SAP size approximately twice that of Hopper's FC packages, and the unit price is more than double. For Rubin, the unit price is expected to increase further. On the other hand, it points out that from a valuation perspective, further upside potential for the stock price is limited. ★10:18 Mobilus - 3rd consecutive day of gains; JR West introduces the company's chatbot and human-assisted chat.

Users can make inquiries regarding lost and found items and WEST QR in three languages: English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), and Korean. The system will commence full operation in February 2025.

円 (+5.1％)　　11:30現在日本ビジネスシステムズ<5036>は高い。前週末２１日取引終了後、自社株買いを実施すると発表した。取得上限は１２０万株（自己株式を除く発行済み株式総数の２．６３％）、または２４億円。期間は１１月２５日～来年２月２８日。これが好感されている。■アドバンテスト<6857>19,205円　+890 円 (+4.9％)　　11:30現在アドバンテスト<6857>が反発、一時１０３５円高の１万９３５０円まで上昇する場面があった。前日の米国株市場では半導体関連株が軒並み上昇し、半導体銘柄で構成されるフィラデルフィア半導体株指数（ＳＯＸ指数）は４．６％高と急騰した。ただ、ＡＩ半導体関連株のシンボルストックであるエヌビディアは２％強の上昇にとどまり、７５日移動平均線を上回れずに取引を終えた。市場ではグーグルが開発した最先端ＡＩモデル「Ｇｅｍｉｎｉ（ジェミニ）３」への期待が大きい一方、同モデルは高性能だけでなく低コストを売り物としており、エヌビディアの最先端ＧＰＵブラックウェルなどへのニーズが中期的に低下するのではないかとの思惑も錯綜している。エヌビディアを主要顧客とするアドテストにとってもネガティブに作用する可能性があるだけに、上値追いにやや慎重となっている面もあるようだ。アドテストは前週末に２５００円強の急落をみせており、きょうはその半値戻しにも満たない状況となっている。■日本毛織<3201>1,764円　+70 円 (+4.1％)　　11:30現在日本毛織<3201>は３日続伸している。前週末２１日の取引終了後、自社株２００万株（消却前の発行済み株式総数の２．６２％）を１１月２８日付で消却すると発表した。消却後の発行済み株式総数は７４２７万８８５８株となる。同時に期末配当予想は従来見通しから５円増額の３０円（前期の期末配当は２４円）にすると開示した。年間配当予想は４７円（前期は４０円）となる。株式需給の引き締まりと前向きな株主還元姿勢を評価した買いが入っている。■ＮＩＳＳＨＡ<7915>1,180円　+42 円 (+3.7％)　　11:30現在ＮＩＳＳＨＡ<7915>は反発。前週末２１日取引終了後、１２月４日付で２８３万９５３８株（発行済み株式総数の５．５８％）の自社株を消却すると発表した。将来の株式の希薄化懸念の払拭と浮動株比率の向上を図るため。これが手掛かりとなっているようだ。■島津製作所<7701>4,502円　+144 円 (+3.3％)　　11:30現在島津製作所<7701>は続伸。ＳＭＢＣ日興証券が２１日付で投資評価を「２（中立）」から「１（アウトパフォーム）」へ、目標株価を４２００円から５５００円へ引き上げたことが材料視されている。同証券によると、計測機器市場における米国の関税影響や政府予算縮小、中国の軟調な市況の影響は概ね出尽くし、今後の不透明感は払拭され始めていると指摘。米中印の計測機器シェア拡大と、新製品や消耗品増による収益性の改善により、業界平均を上回る売り上げ・営業利益成長が期待できるという。■トーメンデバイス<2737>10,800円　+270 円 (+2.6％)　　11:30現在トーメンデバイス<2737>が反発している。同社は２１日取引終了後、韓国の人工知能（ＡＩ）スタートアップ企業であるモビリントと両社間における製品プロモーション及び協業関係拡大を目的とした覚書（ＭＯＵ）を締結したと発表。これが買い手掛かりとなっているようだ。同社は、モビリントのオンプレミス、オンデバイス向け高性能ＡＩプロセッサー（ＮＰＵソリューション）技術によって、低消費電力で従来のプロセッサーの性能不足によって生じるＡＩ市場のさまざまな課題解決に向け共同プロモーションを開始。主な協業内容としては、「日本市場における潜在的な事業の可能性を探り、共同でマーケットの調査・創出」「技術・ノウハウ・マーケティング情報を共有し、新しいビジネスモデルの創出、協業のためのタスクチームを創設」「日本市場での販売・製品開発の連携など相互利益につながる新たな協力関係の創出」などとなっている。■さくらインターネット<3778>3,080円　+70 円 (+2.3％)　　11:30現在さくらインターネット<3778>は堅調。英運用会社のオービス・インベストメント・マネジメントが２１日付で関東財務局に提出した大量保有報告書で、さくらネット株を５．３０％取得したことが判明した。保有目的は「当社の管理下にあるファンドの資産運用のための投資」としている。報告義務発生日は１１月１４日。■みずほＦＧ<8411>5,183円　+20 円 (+0.4％)　　11:30現在みずほフィナンシャルグループ<8411>が堅調。日本経済新聞・電子版は２２日に日銀の増一行審議委員が利上げ判断に関して「近づいている」と述べたと報道した。同氏は「利上げをしていい環境は整ってきていると思う」と発言したという。日銀は、年内は１２月１８～１９日に、新年は１月２２～２３日に金融政策決定会合を予定しているが、追加利上げ思惑から銀行株に対する買いが流入している。■コンヴァノ<6574>110円　-14 円 (-11.3％)　　11:30現在コンヴァノ<6574>は５日ぶり反落。前週末２１日取引終了後、２６年３月期連結業績予想の修正を発表。売上高を１２３億７０００万円から１４９億５０００万円（前期比４．６倍）へ上方修正した一方、営業利益を６５億３５００万円から５９億９０００万円（前期１億３５００万円）へ下方修正した。ビットコインを用いたトレジャリー偏重から、本業起点の事業成長とＭ＆Ａ・成長投資を重視する財務戦略に軸足を移す方針へ戦略を見直し、この影響を織り込んだ。足もとの受注や販売動向なども踏まえた。利益の下振れ見通しが嫌気されている。■ソフトバンクグループ<9984>15,980円　-1,110 円 (-6.5％)　　11:30現在　東証プライム下落率トップソフトバンクグループ<9984>が軟調展開。前週末に２０００円あまりの急落に見舞われたが、きょうは先物主導のインデックス買いや空売り筋のショートカバーなどを誘導しているが上値が重い。前日の米国株市場ではハイテク株比率の高いナスダック総合株価指数が２．７％高と大幅高に買われたほか、半導体銘柄で構成されるフィラデルフィア半導体株指数（ＳＯＸ指数）は４．６％高と急騰した。米ハイテク企業に積極投資するソフトバンクＧにとっては足もとで追い風となる。ただ、米ハイテク株高を牽引したのはグーグルを傘下におくアルファベットで、同社の開発した最先端ＡＩモデル「Ｇｅｍｉｎｉ（ジェミニ）３」への高評価が同社株を押し上げ、全体リスクオン相場にも貢献する形となったが、ジェミニ３は高性能かつ低コストを売り物としており、「ＡＩデータセンターへの過剰投資に警鐘を鳴らす材料ともなり得る」（証券系アナリスト）という指摘もある。ソフトバンクＧの株価に、マイナスに働く可能性も指摘される。■ナカニシ<7716>1,948円　-95 円 (-4.7％)　　11:30現在ナカニシ<7716>は反落。ＳＭＢＣ日興証券が２１日付で投資評価を「１（アウトパフォーム）」から「２（中立）」へ、目標株価を３０００円から２４００円へ引き下げたことが売り材料視されている。同証券によると、情勢不透明感から２５年１２月期に未消化だった先行投資費用増が２６年１２月期に発生するシナリオを想定。加えて、米国歯科用ハンドピースの市場シェア増が従来想定よりも緩やかになっている点、買収した歯科チェアを販売するＤＣＩのＤＳＯ向け販売と市場開拓の遅れ、中国メーカーとの競合リスクも指摘した。■岡部<5959>910円　-17 円 (-1.8％)　　11:30現在岡部<5959>は３日ぶりに反落している。前週末２１日の取引終了後、株式の売り出しを決議したと発表しており、株式需給の悪化が警戒された。みずほフィナンシャルグループ<8411>傘下のみずほ銀行と三菱ＵＦＪフィナンシャル・グループ<8306>傘下の三菱ＵＦＪ銀行がそれぞれ１００万株、合計２００万株を売り出すとしており、これを嫌気した売りが出ている。需要状況に応じて上限３０万株のオーバーアロットメントによる売り出しも予定する。売出価格は１２月２日から４日までのいずれかの日に決める。あわせて岡部は自社株２００万株（発行済み株式総数の４．０６％）を１２月１０日に消却する予定だと発表した。■免疫生物研究所<4570>1,719円　+300 円 (+21.1％) ストップ高　　11:30現在免疫生物研究所<4570>への物色人気が加速、３００円高はストップ高となる１７１９円に張り付いている。ここ短期間で株価を３倍化させるなどマーケットの注目を集めていたが、モメンタム相場の典型で前週末２１日は乱高下、朝方に約３００円安まで売り込まれた後に切り返し、一時２００円以上の上昇を見せたが、その後再び軟化するなど高値波乱の様相を呈した。今月１２日に熊本大学、医薬基盤・健康・栄養研究所、ＣＵＲＥＤ（熊本市）と出願していた「抗ＨＩＶ抗体及びその製造方法」について、米国特許庁から特許査定の通知を受領したことを発表しており、これを材料に大相場となったが、時価は需給相場の色が濃い。直近では前週後半に貸株市場を通じた空売りが急増しており、この買い戻しが株価を押し上げる格好となっているもようだ。■インタートレード<3747>790円　+83 円 (+11.7％)　　11:30現在インタートレード<3747>は大幅高で４日続伸。この日午前１０時２５分ごろ、２６年９月期連結業績予想について純利益を８０００万円から２億４０００万円（前期１億４５００万円の赤字）へ上方修正すると発表した。これが好感されている。持ち分法適用会社のデジタルアセットマーケッツが複数の国内企業を引受先とする増資を行ったことに伴い、持ち分変動利益が発生することになったため。なお、売上高、営業利益見通しに変更はない。■アスカネット<2438>370円　+35 円 (+10.5％)　　11:30現在アスカネット<2438>が大幅高となっている。前週末２１日の取引終了後、取得総数６０万株（自己株式を除く発行済み株式総数の３．８６％）、取得総額２億円を上限とする自社株買いの実施を発表しており、株主還元姿勢を好感した買いが集まっている。取得期間は１２月１１日から来年４月２２日まで。■メディア総研<9242>2,167円　+400 円 (+22.6％) ストップ高買い気配　　11:30現在メディア総研<9242>がカイ気配スタートで３連騰。同社は高校生や大学生向けの就職活動イベントの企画・運営を手掛けているが、足もとの業績は拡大トレンドが顕著だ。株価は今月に入って急動意、１２日の取引時間中に２５３７円まで一気に水準を切り上げたものの、その後は一転して急反落に転じ、ほぼ往って来いの状況となっていた。前週後半に売り物が切れ下げ止まり、きょうは改めて買いに勢いがついている。前週末２１日取引終了後、同社は株主優待制度を導入することを発表した。毎年１月末と７月末時点で２００株以上を保有する株主を対象に、株主優待ポイント(保有株数に応じて３０００～２万５０００ポイント)を年２回付与、優待ポイントは株主限定の特設ウェブサイトで、グルメ、家電製品、体験ギフトなど５０００種類以上の商品から交換可能であり、これを材料視する投資資金が集中した。●ストップ高銘柄ハンワホームズ<275A>605円　+100

■Japan Business Systems <5036> 1,457 yen +70 yen (+5.1%) As of 11:30 AM. Japan Business Systems <5036> is trading higher. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would conduct a share buyback. The upper limit for acquisition is 1.2 million shares (2.63% of the total outstanding shares excluding treasury stock), or 2.4 billion yen. The period is from November 25th to February 28th next year. This has been well-received.
■Advantest <6857> 19,205 yen +890 yen (+4.9%) As of 11:30 AM. Advantest <6857> rebounded, at one point rising by 1,035 yen to 19,350 yen. In the U.S. stock market yesterday, semiconductor-related stocks rose across the board, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, surged by 4.6%. However, Nvidia, a symbolic stock among AI semiconductor-related companies, only rose by a little over 2% and closed trading without surpassing its 75-day moving average. While there are high expectations in the market for ""Gemini 3,"" the cutting-edge AI model developed by Google, this model is touted not only for its high performance but also for its low cost. This has led to mixed speculation that demand for Nvidia's cutting-edge GPUs like Blackwell might decline in the medium term. Given that this could negatively impact Advantest, which has Nvidia as a major customer, there seems to be some caution in pursuing further upside. Advantest saw a sharp decline of over 2,500 yen last Friday, and today's rise is less than half of that recovery.
■Nippon Keori <3201> 1,764 yen +70 yen (+4.1%) As of 11:30 AM. Nippon Keori <3201> has risen for three consecutive days. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would cancel 2 million treasury shares (2.62% of the total outstanding shares before cancellation) on November 28th. The total outstanding shares after cancellation will be 74,278,858 shares. At the same time, it disclosed that the year-end dividend forecast would be increased by 5 yen from the previous outlook to 30 yen (the previous fiscal year's year-end dividend was 24 yen). The annual dividend forecast will be 47 yen (40 yen in the previous fiscal year). Buying is coming in, evaluating the tightening of stock supply and demand and the positive stance on shareholder returns.
■NISSHA <7915> 1,180 yen +42 yen (+3.7%) As of 11:30 AM. NISSHA <7915> rebounded. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would cancel 2,839,538 treasury shares (5.58% of the total outstanding shares) on December 4th. This is aimed at dispelling concerns about future stock dilution and improving the free-float ratio. This appears to be the catalyst.
■Shimadzu Corporation <7701> 4,502 yen +144 yen (+3.3%) As of 11:30 AM. Shimadzu Corporation <7701> continued to rise. The stock is being driven by SMBC Nikko Securities raising its investment rating from ""2 (Neutral)"" to ""1 (Outperform)"" and its target price from 4,200 yen to 5,500 yen on the 21st. According to the securities firm, the impact of U.S. tariffs, reduced government budgets, and a sluggish market in China on the measuring instrument market has largely run its course, and future uncertainties are beginning to dissipate. It expects sales and operating profit growth above the industry average due to expanding market share for measuring instruments in the U.S., China, and India, and improved profitability from new products and increased consumables.
■Tomen Devices <2737> 10,800 yen +270 yen (+2.6%) As of 11:30 AM. Tomen Devices <2737> has rebounded. After the close of trading on the 21st, the company announced it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Mobilint, a South Korean artificial intelligence (AI) startup, aimed at product promotion and expanding their collaborative relationship. This appears to be a buying catalyst. The company has begun joint promotion to solve various challenges in the AI market caused by the performance limitations of conventional processors, using Mobilint's high-performance AI processor (NPU solution) technology for on-premise and on-device applications, which offers low power consumption. Key areas of collaboration include: ""Exploring potential business opportunities in the Japanese market and jointly conducting market research and creation,"" ""Sharing technology, know-how, and marketing information to create new business models and establish a task team for collaboration,"" and ""Creating new cooperative relationships that lead to mutual benefits, such as sales and product development collaboration in the Japanese market.""
■Sakura Internet <3778> 3,080 yen +70 yen (+2.3%) As of 11:30 AM. Sakura Internet <3778> is firm. It was revealed in a large shareholding report submitted to the Kanto Local Finance Bureau by British asset management company Orbis Investment Management on the 21st that it had acquired 5.30% of Sakura Internet shares. The purpose of the holding is stated as ""investment for asset management of funds under our management."" The obligation to report arose on November 14th.
■Mizuho FG <8411> 5,183 yen +20 yen (+0.4%) As of 11:30 AM. Mizuho Financial Group <8411> is firm. The Nikkei Shimbun's online edition reported on the 22nd that Bank of Japan Policy Board member Hajime Takata stated that the decision on interest rate hikes is ""approaching."" He reportedly said, ""I believe the environment is becoming ready for an interest rate hike."" The Bank of Japan has scheduled Monetary Policy Meetings for December 18-19 this year and January 22-23 next year, and buying is flowing into bank stocks due to speculation of additional rate hikes.
■Convano <6574> 110 yen -14 yen (-11.3%) As of 11:30 AM. Convano <6574> declined for the first time in five days. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced a revision to its consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026. While net sales were revised upward from 12.37 billion yen to 14.95 billion yen (4.6 times the previous fiscal year), operating profit was revised downward from 6.535 billion yen to 5.99 billion yen (135 million yen in the previous fiscal year). The company revised its strategy to shift its financial focus from treasury-heavy operations using Bitcoin to a strategy emphasizing business growth from its core operations and M&A/growth investments, and this impact has been incorporated. Current order and sales trends were also taken into account. The downward revision of profit outlook is being viewed negatively.
■SoftBank Group <9984> 15,980 yen -1,110 yen (-6.5%) As of 11:30 AM. Top decliner on TSE Prime. SoftBank Group <9984> is showing weak performance. While it suffered a sharp decline of over 2,000 yen last Friday, today's trading is seeing futures-led index buying and short covering by short sellers, but the upside remains heavy. In the U.S. stock market yesterday, the Nasdaq Composite Index, which has a high proportion of tech stocks, was bought up significantly, rising 2.7%, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, surged by 4.6%. This provides a tailwind for SoftBank Group, which actively invests in U.S. tech companies. However, the surge in U.S. tech stocks was led by Alphabet, Google's parent company, whose cutting-edge AI model ""Gemini 3"" received high praise, boosting its stock and contributing to the overall risk-on market. But Gemini 3 is touted for both high performance and low cost, leading some (securities analysts) to point out that it ""could also serve as a warning against excessive investment in AI data centers."" It is also pointed out that this could negatively impact SoftBank Group's stock price.
■Nakanishi <7716> 1,948 yen -95 yen (-4.7%) As of 11:30 AM. Nakanishi <7716> declined. The stock is being sold off after SMBC Nikko Securities lowered its investment rating from ""1 (Outperform)"" to ""2 (Neutral)"" and its target price from 3,000 yen to 2,400 yen on the 21st. According to the securities firm, due to uncertain circumstances, it anticipates a scenario where increased upfront investment costs that were unspent in the fiscal year ending December 2025 will occur in the fiscal year ending December 2026. Additionally, it pointed out that the increase in market share for dental handpieces in the U.S. is slower than previously expected, there are delays in sales to DSOs (Dental Service Organizations) and market development for DCI, which sells acquired dental chairs, and there is a risk of competition with Chinese manufacturers.
■Okabe <5959> 910 yen -17 yen (-1.8%) As of 11:30 AM. Okabe <5959> declined for the first time in three days. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced a resolution for a secondary offering of shares, raising concerns about a deterioration in stock supply and demand. Mizuho Bank, a subsidiary of Mizuho Financial Group <8411>, and MUFG Bank, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306>, are each planning to sell 1 million shares, totaling 2 million shares, which has led to selling pressure. A secondary offering of up to 300,000 shares via over-allotment is also planned, depending on demand. The offering price will be determined on one of the days between December 2nd and 4th. Additionally, Okabe announced it plans to cancel 2 million treasury shares (4.06% of the total outstanding shares) on December 10th.
■Immuno-Biological Laboratories <4570> 1,719 yen +300 yen (+21.1%) Limit up As of 11:30 AM. Buying interest in Immuno-Biological Laboratories <4570> is accelerating, with the stock hitting its limit up at 1,719 yen, a gain of 300 yen. The stock had attracted market attention by tripling in a short period, but in a typical momentum play, it saw volatile trading last Friday, the 21st. After being sold down by about 300 yen in the morning, it rebounded, showing a temporary rise of over 200 yen, but then softened again, indicating high-price volatility. On the 12th of this month, the company announced it had received a notice of patent allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for ""Anti-HIV antibodies and methods for producing the same,"" which it had applied for jointly with Kumamoto University, the National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, and CURED (Kumamoto City). This news triggered a major rally, but the current price strongly reflects supply and demand dynamics. Recently, short selling through the stock lending market surged in the latter half of last week, and it appears that this short covering is pushing up the stock price.
■Intertrade <3747> 790 yen +83 yen (+11.7%) As of 11:30 AM. Intertrade <3747> surged, rising for four consecutive days. Around 10:25 AM today, the company announced an upward revision to its consolidated net profit forecast for the fiscal year ending September 2026, from 80 million yen to 240 million yen (compared to a loss of 145 million yen in the previous fiscal year). This has been well-received. This is due to a gain from changes in equity interest resulting from an increase in capital by its equity-method affiliate, Digital Asset Markets, with several domestic companies as underwriters. There are no changes to the net sales and operating profit forecasts.
■AscaNet <2438> 370 yen +35 yen (+10.5%) As of 11:30 AM. AscaNet <2438> is significantly higher. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would conduct a share buyback with an upper limit of 600,000 shares (3.86% of the total outstanding shares excluding treasury stock) or 200 million yen. Buying is gathering, favoring the company's stance on shareholder returns. The acquisition period is from December 11th to April 22nd next year.
■Media Souken <9242> 2,167 yen +400 yen (+22.6%) Bid-only limit up As of 11:30 AM. Media Souken <9242> started with a bid-only limit up and has risen for three consecutive days. The company plans and operates job-hunting events for high school and university students, and its current performance shows a clear expansion trend. The stock price moved sharply this month, surging to 2,537 yen during trading hours on the 12th, but then sharply reversed and declined, almost returning to its starting point. In the latter half of last week, selling pressure subsided, and today, buying momentum has picked up again.

In the U.S. stock market the previous day, semiconductor-related stocks all rose, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, surged by 4.6%. However, Nvidia <NVDA>, a symbolic stock among AI semiconductor-related stocks, only rose by slightly over 2%, closing trading without surpassing its 75-day moving average. While there are high expectations in the market for ""Gemini 3,"" the cutting-edge AI model developed by Google, speculation is also intertwined that this model, which boasts not only high performance but also low cost, might lead to a mid-term decline in demand for Nvidia's cutting-edge GPUs like Blackwell. Given that this could also negatively impact Advantest, which counts Nvidia as a major customer, there seems to be some caution regarding chasing further upside.

Around 2 PM on the 21st, the company announced a share buyback with an upper limit of 50,000 shares (0.12% of outstanding shares excluding treasury stock) and a total acquisition value of 50 million yen, which led to buying interest. The acquisition period will be from December 1st to December 30th, and will be conducted through market purchases, including off-auction own share repurchase transactions (ToSTNeT-3) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This aims to implement a flexible capital policy in response to changes in the business environment and improve capital efficiency.■Fuji<8278> 2,064 yen +48 yen (+2.4%) Today's closing priceFuji <8278> remained firm.

After the close of trading on the 20th, the company announced an upward revision to its dividend forecast, which was viewed positively. The year-end dividend forecast was revised up by 4 yen from the previous outlook to 22 yen. The annual dividend forecast is 37 yen (23 yen in the previous fiscal year). Furthermore, the company decided to cancel the share buyback, which was decided in February, as of November 20th. Taking into comprehensive consideration business performance, the management environment, and changes in the stock market, approximately 100 million yen of the unexecuted portion will be reallocated to a part of the year-end dividend.■EIZO<6737> 2,205 yen +47 yen (+2.2%) Today's closing priceEIZO <6737> showed firm movement. On the 21st, the company announced that it would cancel 1,631,500 shares of its own stock, equivalent to 3.71% of its outstanding shares, on December 10th. This was seen as a positive factor for the stock price, as the potential risk of worsening supply and demand due to re-issuance into the market receded. The total number of outstanding shares after cancellation, including treasury stock, will be 42,330,820 shares.■Juroku FG<7380> 6,120 yen +130 yen (+2.2%) Today's closing priceJuroku Financial Group <7380> rebounded after an early morning dip and updated its year-to-date high.

In the foreign exchange market, the dollar-yen rate remained in the 157 yen range, continuing its depreciation trend. The dollar strengthened and the yen weakened due to the perception of increased medium-term fiscal deterioration risk following the economic measures of the Takaichi administration. Although the yen selling trend has somewhat paused compared to before due to concerns about currency intervention, the mid-term yen depreciation trend is still recognized, and automotive stocks are expected to benefit from improved export profitability, thus attracting buying interest.■Anicom HD<8715> 857 yen +12 yen (+1.4%) Today's closing priceAnicom Holdings <8715> remained firm. After the close of trading on the 20th, the company released its monthly business parameters for October. Net earned premiums amounted to 5.415 billion yen (up 10.3% year-on-year).

According to the article, the capacity will be more than 100 times that of Maxell's mass-produced all-solid-state batteries for small devices, and their durability will be several times that of lead-acid batteries. The company plans to invest several tens of billions of yen after fiscal year 2030 to establish a mass production system.■J Trust<8508> 426 yen +2 yen (+0.5%) Today's closing priceJ Trust <8508> remained firm.

The company announced its October monthly performance the previous day. Operating profit increased by 9.3% year-on-year, and although the growth rate remained in the single digits for the first time since March, this appears to have led to a sense of relief, given the concerns about the rapid depreciation of the yen. Individual full-year operating profit is expected to land with a 17.3% increase, and the previous fiscal year's profit is also seen as largely in line with consensus. Today, amid a decline in the overall market, its defensive nature is also considered a tailwind. Sanrio <8136>: 5,436 yen (+194 yen) sharply rebounded. The company announced the implementation of a share buyback program, acquiring up to 3.3 million shares, representing 1.34% of outstanding shares, or 15 billion yen. The acquisition period is from November 21 to February 10, 2026. The recent decline in the stock price is cited as the main reason for the share buyback. The company also stated that it will comprehensively consider the stock price situation and investment opportunities, and will consider further share buybacks beyond this instance if opportunities arise. With the stock price in a low range, the strong management awareness regarding the stock price has been confirmed, leading to a reevaluation. Kioxia HD <285A>: 9,540 yen (-1,795 yen) sharply fell, leading the decline. SanDisk, a US company that jointly operates factories with Kioxia and whose stock price has a strong correlation, saw a significant decline of over 20% in the US market the previous day, leading to a sympathetic decline in Kioxia's stock. The reasons behind SanDisk's decline include renewed strong concerns about overheating in AI-related stocks after Nvidia's stock price stalled despite announcing earnings that beat market expectations, as well as receding expectations for US interest rate cuts. Toyoda Gosei <7282>: 3,430 yen (-324 yen) sharply fell. The company announced a secondary offering of 29,746,000 shares and an over-allotment offering of up to 4,461,800 shares. The sellers are Toyota Motor Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The offering price will be determined between December 1 and 4. Concerns about a short-term deterioration in supply and demand are leading the market. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact on supply and demand from the secondary offering, the company announced a share buyback of up to 10 million shares, representing 7.86% of outstanding shares. Advantest <6857>: 18,535 yen (-2,300 yen) sharply fell. The previous day, a sense of relief grew after US Nvidia's stock rose in after-hours trading following its earnings announcement, leading to a significant rally. However, today, the stock reversed course, erasing the previous day's gains. Nvidia started with buying in the US market the previous day but then struggled to extend gains, ending down over 3%. It appears that renewed concerns about overheating in AI-related stocks are being strongly felt. Furthermore, receding expectations for US interest rate cuts are also a headwind for tech stocks. Axis C <9344>: 888 yen (+43 yen) sharply continued its rise. After the close of trading on the 20th, the company announced the establishment of a new shareholder benefit program, which is viewed as positive news. The first record date will be December 31, 2025, and thereafter, shareholders who hold 100 or more shares of the company's stock as recorded in the shareholder registry as of December 31 each year will receive a digital gift worth 1,000 yen for each record date. The purpose of introducing the shareholder benefit program is to build even better relationships with shareholders, increase awareness of the company's stock, enhance its investment appeal, and improve market liquidity. MFS <196A>: 280 yen (+11 yen) surged. The company announced a capital and business alliance with Zenkoku Hosho.

The depreciation of the yen against the dollar has progressed in the foreign exchange market, rising to the 157 yen level, leading to increased selling pressure on companies like Nitori and Kobe Bussan, which are considered strong-yen benefit stocks. Yen selling intensified after a three-party meeting involving Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda and Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, and this trend continued during U.S. trading hours. In the U.S., the decision not to release the October employment statistics seems to have strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will postpone an interest rate cut at the December FOMC meeting.Tokio Marine<8766>: 5389 yen (-422 yen) sharply declined. The company announced its first-half financial results the previous day, with net profit at 686.8 billion yen, a 0.2% decrease year-on-year. The full-year forecast was revised downward from the previous estimate of 930 billion yen to 910 billion yen, representing a 13.8% decrease from the previous fiscal year. It appears the company expects to record a loss on sale of approximately 30 billion yen. The prevailing view seems to be that its current performance is inferior compared to other non-life insurers like SOMPO. Additionally, the company announced a tender offer for its own shares at 5220 yen per share, with the planned number of shares to be acquired set at 24,904,100 shares. Mitsubishi UFJ Bank and others are expected to apply.Tokyo Electric Power HD<9501>: 832.7 yen (-35.3 yen) continued its sharp decline. It has been reported that multiple deficiencies in the management of classified documents related to anti-terrorism measures were discovered at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in June. The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) is expected to hold a closed-door extraordinary meeting to discuss future actions. Although no external leakage has been confirmed, concerns about restarting the plant are growing, as the NRA may prohibit its operation if serious deterioration or irregularities in security measures are confirmed.SOMPO<8630>: 4916 yen (+433 yen) sharply rebounded. The company announced its first-half financial results the previous day. Net profit was 360.4 billion yen, a 97.4% increase year-on-year, and the full-year forecast was revised upward from the previous 335 billion yen to 540 billion yen, reaching 2.2 times the level of the previous fiscal year. Factors contributing to this include an increase in unrealized gains/losses on financial instruments and the expectation that insurance claims from natural disasters both domestically and internationally will be lower than anticipated. Additionally, the company announced a share buyback program, with an upper limit of 24 million shares, representing 2.64% of outstanding shares, and a total cost of 77 billion yen.Advantest<6857>: 20800 yen (+1650 yen) sharply rebounded. Following the announcement of U.S. Nvidia's August-October financial results, which saw its stock rise over 5% in after-hours trading, a sense of buying relief has spread to domestic semiconductor-related companies like Advantest. Both revenue and profit exceeded market expectations, setting new quarterly records. The revenue outlook for the November-January quarter is also around 65 billion dollars, a 65% increase year-on-year, surpassing market expectations of approximately 62 billion dollars. As earnings hurdles were considered high, the confirmation of a positive stock price reaction has strengthened dip-buying interest.Material Group<156A>: 704 yen (+38 yen) continued its sharp rise. After the close of trading on the 19th, the company announced a share buyback program, with an upper limit of 300,000 shares (3.1% of outstanding shares excluding treasury stock) and a total acquisition cost of 246 million yen, which is viewed as positive news. The acquisition period is from November 20, 2025, to February 28, 2026. The reasons for the share buyback are stated as implementing a flexible capital policy in response to changes in the business environment and enhancing shareholder returns. It is also being conducted in preparation for the future disposal of treasury stock for restricted stock compensation and the exercise of stock options.Renaissance<4889>: 1939 yen (+89 yen) continued to rise. The company announced the start of development of the PAI-1 inhibitor RS5614 as a veterinary drug (for dogs and cats), which is seen as positive news. This is because the anti-aging and longevity effects and pharmacological properties of RS5614 are expected to be useful not only in human medicine but also in the animal medical field, particularly for companion animals such as dogs and cats. Specifically, non-clinical (safety) and clinical trials are planned to assess its effectiveness in dogs (for conditions like arthritis, melanoma, and hemangiosarcoma, which are skin cancers) and cats (for chronic kidney disease), and safety confirmation trials in dogs and cats have already commenced.Zenmu<338A>: 6280 yen (+120 yen) rebounded. The company announced the start of a joint study with Ajira and Logic and Design to build a next-generation data platform that integrates different technological domains—AI, image enhancement, and secret sharing—to solve social issues and create new value, which is viewed as positive news. In an era where video, AI, and data support all societal activities, developing a data utilization infrastructure that achieves high levels of ""security,"" ""reliability,"" and ""convenience"" simultaneously is an urgent task.

It maintained its ""Neutral"" investment rating and lowered its target price from 2,400 yen to 2,200 yen. Concurrently with its Q3 financial results, the company announced a new medium-term management plan starting in the fiscal year ending December 2026, and the recording of impairment losses on goodwill (related to its Americas business).

It maintained its ""Neutral"" investment rating and raised its target price from 6,700 yen to 8,500 yen. Mizuho raised the target price based on the rising multiples of US and European obesity-related drug companies such as Eli Lilly, and the rising consensus for sales forecasts of ""Orforglipron,"" which was licensed to Eli Lilly. Its earnings forecast increased royalty income related to ""Orforglipron"" and ""Nemluvio"" (Galderma). Key points of interest going forward are considered to be the US approval of Orforglipron, its sales launch, and the results of the Phase 2 trial for obesity of GYM329, which has muscle-strengthening effects. ★14:42 Shinto Holdings - Widens gains in afternoon session; starts operation of AI-compatible containerized data center manufacturing base.

The price revision range is 20 yen to 50 yen per kilogram. It will be implemented from shipments on December 1. In addition to soaring labor costs, logistics and storage costs, equipment costs for measures against aging manufacturing machinery and for establishing a resource circulation model have also surged. Furthermore, it states that it is implementing the price revision because it has no choice but to accept strong price increase requests from major raw material manufacturers. ★14:56 Mitsubishi Electric - Sharp rebound after 3 days; develops long-range LiDAR for railways. Mitsubishi Electric <6503> saw a sharp rebound after 3 days. The company announced on the 20th that it has developed the industry's first long-range LiDAR for railways (a device that measures the distance and shape of objects by emitting laser light and acquiring point cloud data from its reflection), capable of detecting people and obstacles up to 600 meters away. This technology enables the detection of people 600 meters away when LiDAR is mounted in the driver's seat of a railway vehicle for forward monitoring during train operation, and also enables the detection of small fallen objects of about 20 centimeters 600 meters away when fixedly installed along railway lines for safety confirmation. Furthermore, it states that the object detection AI installed in the accompanying LiDAR control device can identify the types of obstacles that are difficult to specify from point cloud data alone, with high speed and accuracy.

Chiyoda Corporation <6366> saw its stock price fall for the first time in six trading days. Daiwa Securities judged that business conditions have significantly improved. It maintained its investment rating at '3 (Neutral)' and raised its target price from 350 yen to 600 yen. Daiwa believes that business conditions are steadily improving, and in the engineering business, which primarily involves lump-sum contracts, unforeseen profit and loss fluctuations always occur. The biggest characteristic, according to Daiwa, is that 'events that negate positive factors no longer occur.' On the other hand, due to the reduction in outstanding projects as large-scale projects are completed sequentially, it is difficult to expect an increase in operating profit for the next fiscal year, and the selection and securing of 'projects leading to the next' was pointed out as one of the challenges. The equity ratio has recovered to the 10% range, and cash and deposits are accumulating, making the treatment of preferred shares an even greater point of focus than before. ★12:50 NEC - Rebounds for the first time in 4 days; launches industry's first online delivery service for TV programs. NEC <6701> rebounded for the first time in four trading days. The company announced at 11:00 on the 19th that it has officially launched an online delivery service for TV programs, targeting TV stations and program delivery operators, which is the industry's first service capable of delivering programs across broadcasting networks. This service anticipates the future discontinuation of physical media, which has been used for TV program delivery, and provides an online alternative that has become an urgent issue for TV stations, advertising agencies, and program distribution companies. Some companies began using the service in advance from August 2025, and it is now officially launched. The company stated that through this service, it will promote DX in program delivery operations and contribute to the revitalization of domestic content distribution. ★12:56 Hoshizaki - Falls back; expands product lineup adopting natural refrigerants. Hoshizaki <6465> fell back. The company announced on the 19th that it will expand its product lineup adopting natural refrigerants, which are non-fluorocarbon and have a low environmental impact. In addition to standard commercial refrigerators and some ice makers and refrigeration equipment that have already completed the transition to natural refrigerants, 66 models across four product groups, including the 'Chip Ice Maker' ice machine, will be remodeled. Sales will commence sequentially from mid-December 2025 through 15 sales companies nationwide. Furthermore, selling pressure is dominant due to the weak market sentiment. ★12:56 Hitachi, Ltd. - Mizuho raises target price; acceleration of portfolio reform also expected. Hitachi, Ltd. <6501> showed weakness. Mizuho Securities expects accelerated portfolio reform in addition to mid-term growth related to DX/GX. It maintained its 'Buy' investment rating and raised its target price from 5,000 yen to 5,900 yen. Mizuho pointed out that the probability of sustainable profit growth driven by DX/GX-related factors has further increased. As a result, it believes there is a possibility of another upward revaluation (=shift of the valuation base year to the future). Furthermore, looking towards 2026, it is also focusing on i) the possibility of re-accelerating business portfolio reform, primarily centered on CI, and ii) the progress of initiatives to expand digital service businesses in areas such as energy and railways through the utilization of digital technology. ★13:06 Cados - Surges temporarily in the afternoon session; receives large order worth approximately 1 billion yen. Cados Corporation <211A> surged temporarily in the afternoon session. The company announced at 13:00 on the 19th that it has received a large order for the new construction of a home appliance mass retailer. The order amount is approximately 1 billion yen, excluding tax. Sales are scheduled to be recorded based on the percentage-of-completion method from December 2025 to September 2026. This has already been incorporated into the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending July 2026. ★13:07 Skylark - Mizuho raises target price; revised profit guidance expected to be achievable. Skylark Holdings <3197> saw a significant rebound. Mizuho Securities expects the revised profit guidance to be achievable. It maintained its 'Neutral' investment rating and raised its target price from 2,850 yen to 3,150 yen. Mizuho revised its earnings forecast based on the Q3 FY2025/12 results. While an upward revision to guidance was announced at the time of the Q3 results, the Q4 plan largely remained at the initial plan, suggesting potential for upside in terms of profit. While Mizuho evaluates the shift from a conventional cost-cutting-focused policy to a store-centric management policy, it continues to view the stock as lacking a sense of undervaluation in terms of stock price indicators. The monthly sales of 'Sukesan Udon' are said to be about three times higher than existing brands, boasting strong customer attraction.

After the close of trading on the previous day, the company had disclosed that it would entrust the repurchase of up to 400,000 of its own shares (total acquisition amount of 981.2 million yen) via ToSTNeT-3 at 8:45 AM on the 19th. Buying appears to have been prompted by a favorable view of its efforts to improve capital efficiency.■Saint Marc <3395> 2,537 yen +22 yen (+0.9%) Closing price today Saint Marc Holdings <3395> rebounded for the first time in four days. After the close of trading on the 18th, the company announced a revision to its medium-term management plan, with the fiscal year ending March 2029 as the final year, which was viewed favorably. The revision was carried out because the company is now expected to achieve its target consolidated sales of 80 billion yen in the current fiscal year, thanks to M&A in the gyukatsu (beef cutlet) business conducted in November and December last year. As new numerical targets, it expects sales of 100 billion yen and operating profit before amortization of goodwill, etc., of 9 billion yen.■Sawai GHD <4887> 1,882 yen +7 yen (+0.4%) Closing price today Sawai Group Holdings <4887> remained firm. It was revealed on the 18th that UK-based Silchester International Investors had increased its stake in Sawai GHD, which appears to have attracted speculative buying. According to an amendment report submitted on the same day, Silchester's ownership ratio increased from 5.72% to 6.83%. The date of occurrence of the reporting obligation was the 14th. The purpose of holding section states: 'May request an increase in dividends, the frequency or total amount of share repurchases, cancellation of treasury shares, or other changes in capital policy.'■Toyota Motor <7203> 3,037 yen +8 yen (+0.3%) Closing price today Toyota Motor <7203> showed robust price movements amidst mixed buying and selling. Although it had fallen for three consecutive days until the previous day, declining by more than 5%, buying driven by expectations of a rebound is currently dominant. The rapid depreciation of the yen in the foreign exchange market is seen as a tailwind for the company's shares, which stand out among manufacturers for their high sensitivity to exchange rates. Currently, the dollar-yen rate is around 155 yen to the dollar, and the euro-yen rate is around 180 yen to the euro. However, the company's assumed full-year exchange rates for the fiscal year ending March 2026 are 146 yen to the dollar and 169 yen to the euro, respectively. With the yen significantly weaker than these assumptions, the company is expected to benefit from exchange rate gains. Furthermore, the company announced on the 18th that it would invest a total of 912 million dollars, or approximately 140 billion yen, in five plants in the U.S. to strengthen local production of hybrid vehicles (HVs), which are selling well in the U.S. This also appears to have stimulated the stock price.■Shimano <7309> 14,930 yen -500 yen (-3.2%) Closing price today Shimano <7309> fell for the third consecutive day. After the close of trading on the 18th, the company announced that it would cancel 1.18 million of its own shares (1.35% of outstanding shares before cancellation) effective November 26, but this move appears to have had a limited positive impact. The number of outstanding shares after cancellation will be 86.53 million.■Kyokuyo <1301> 4,570 yen -85 yen (-1.8%) Closing price today Fishery stocks such as Kyokuyo <1301>, Maruha Nichiro <1333>, and Nissui <1332> all turned negative in the afternoon session. Selling emerged due to concerns about the impact on earnings after Kyodo News reported in the afternoon that 'the Chinese government informed the Japanese government on the 19th that it would halt imports of Japanese marine products.' Additionally, Yoshimura Food Holdings <2884>, which handles scallop export and sales business within its group, also plummeted.■Advantest <6857> 19,150 yen -110 yen (-0.6%) Closing price today Semiconductor manufacturing equipment-related stocks such as Advantest <6857> and Disco <6146> saw mixed buying and selling, but were somewhat pressured by selling. In the U.S. stock market on the previous day, AI-related stocks and the semiconductor sector faced strong selling pressure, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, fell 2.3% for the fourth consecutive day, intensifying its search for lower support. Ahead of the earnings announcement for the August-October 2025 period by U.S. graphics processing semiconductor giant Nvidia on the 19th local time (early morning of the 20th Japan time), a wait-and-see mood intensified due to speculation about wanting to assess the content. This trend has also spread to the Tokyo market, but it is a difficult time for immediate buying, especially for Advantest, which has Nvidia as a major customer, and Disco, which is shifting its management strategy to target the generative AI market.",Stock Search News,2025-11-19,Positive,Diverged,-0.028687550541517393,-1.442576573180444,Diverged,T+1,Weak,3037.0,0.2641135688345989,3405.0,-0.1759014951627089,0.44001506399730783,1.4856388246946188,-1.2036434612882239,-0.467699503069278,0.10917451208188528,0.6280001602507218,-0.8175875593180744,3044.0,0.23049061573921634,3459.0,1.5859030837004406,-1.3554124679612243,1.9097793875535067,-1.6478190630048466,-0.5748778384593274,0.08822201697430147,0.7438372880904458,-0.5591224146199665

Regarding the impact of advertising and promotional budget cuts by major clients, the company had expected the situation to improve from the second half, but recovery has not been as anticipated. The lower-than-planned number of new contract acquisitions in the cloud solutions business and sluggish acquisition of mid-sized projects are also contributing factors. Consolidated operating profit for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was 1.86 billion yen (down 6.7% year-on-year).

Olympus - SMBC Nikko raises target price: Expects organizational restructuring effects but notes increased competitive risk. Olympus fell back. SMBC Nikko pointed out that while expecting the effects of organizational restructuring and the fading of one-off factors, competitive risk is increasing. The investment rating was maintained at '2 (Neutral),' and the target price was raised from 1,700 yen to 2,000 yen. SMBC Nikko believes that in the short term, the stock price is likely to maintain a solid momentum due to progress in FDA inspections in the fiscal year ending March 2026, the fading of one-off factors, and expectations of personnel reduction effects towards the fiscal year ending March 2027. On the other hand, it is assumed that competition with Fujifilm will intensify in developed countries, and the rise of local manufacturers in China and India will become full-fledged from the next fiscal year onwards in emerging countries. The introduction of next-generation models is expected from the fiscal year ending March 2029 onwards, and SMBC Nikko believes this is a phase to assess the company's ability to respond to medium- to long-term risk factors.
Schoo - Limit down, bid-only: Forecasts 8% decline in current fiscal year operating profit; previous year was 2.5 times. Schoo hit a limit down, bid-only.

The plan is to continue improving the growth and efficiency of its corporate business while making strategic growth investments to expand into the HR business domain. Operating profit for the full fiscal year ending September 2025 was 290 million yen (2.5 times the previous fiscal year). As a result of focusing on expanding adoption by large corporations, primarily through its main service 'Schoo for Business,' sales grew steadily, accompanied by an improvement in average revenue per account (ARPA).
PRISM BioLab - Surges: Achieves first milestone in drug discovery collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical, receives upfront payment. PRISM BioLab surged. The company announced on the 14th that it has achieved the first milestone in its drug discovery collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and confirmed that it will receive an upfront payment. The two companies concluded a 'Joint Research and License Agreement' concerning drug discovery in the oncology field, effective April 25, 2024. Under this agreement, the company receives an upfront payment and joint research expenses, and is conducting a joint research project to create clinical candidate compounds for drug discovery targets proposed by Ono Pharmaceutical, using the company's proprietary small molecule peptide mimetic technology, 'PepMetics technology,' which targets protein-protein interactions (PPI). The project has progressed as planned under the collaboration of both companies, and having achieved the drug discovery research stage milestone stipulated in the agreement, it has been confirmed that the company will receive a milestone achievement upfront payment and joint research expenses from Ono Pharmaceutical. First, the upfront payment received from this matter will be recorded as business revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 2026, and the joint research expenses will be recorded proportionally according to the next stage of the joint research period. While the specific amounts are undisclosed due to contractual obligations, the total amount of the upfront payment and joint research expenses is expected to be equivalent to 80% of the company's sales for the fiscal year ending September 2026.

The company announced on the 14th that its operating loss for the fiscal year ending September 2025 was 770 million yen (compared to a loss of 780 million yen in the previous fiscal year). Sales were 680 million yen (2.2 times the previous fiscal year). The performance forecast for the current fiscal year is undisclosed as a reasonable forecast cannot be calculated at this time. Furthermore, the announcement on the same day regarding the achievement of the first milestone and receipt of an upfront payment in the drug discovery collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. is also being well-received.
Sharing Technology - Surges: Forecasts 13% increase in current fiscal year operating profit; previous year was 16% increase. Sharing Technology surged. The company announced on the 14th that it forecasts consolidated operating profit (IFRS) for the full fiscal year ending August 2026 to be 2.35 billion yen (up 13.3% year-on-year) and its annual dividend forecast to be 55 yen (compared to 45 yen in the previous fiscal year). Revenue is expected to increase due to an increase in inquiries resulting from strengthened operations of the portal site 'Seikatsu 110-ban' and vertical media sites specialized in various genres, enhanced cooperation with member stores, and an improvement in unit price per inquiry through optimized matching, as well as further expansion of genres and areas by group companies, including As Support. The company expects profit to increase by maintaining the current ratio of expenses to gross profit despite the increase in expenses accompanying the revenue growth. Consolidated operating profit for the full fiscal year ending September 2025 was 2.07 billion yen (up 15.9% year-on-year).",Traders Web,2025-11-17,Positive,Diverged,-0.3117543531625133,4.255506894647083,Diverged,T+1,Weak,1786.0,-0.7502083912197832,3507.0,-0.42589437819420783,-0.3243140130255754,-0.5834954153931647,-0.16769144773616546,-0.11392765593847907,0.0,1.0904584631675345,0.15736455710985398,1745.0,-2.295632698768197,3411.0,-2.737382378100941,0.441749679332744,0.4479283314669653,-2.7313266443701227,-2.12338593974175,-0.9008730328170336,0.7693892103273113,-0.41376535331243336

●【1】Today's Stock Market & Featured Stocks at a Glance!
AI-related stocks rapidly lose momentum, reversing from a 600-yen gain to a fall.

[Today's Market] Nikkei Stock Average slightly falls back!
On the U.S. market on the 10th, major stock indices all rose. Investor sentiment improved due to rising expectations that the government shutdown would be lifted within a few days, and a significant rise in tech stocks, particularly semiconductor giant Nvidia, which reportedly received increased production requests from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Although news of the government shutdown lifting had been circulating since the previous day, the Nikkei Stock Average briefly rose to 51,513.16 yen (+601.4 yen) in early trading today. Expectations seemed to have further increased with reports that a provisional budget bill was expected to pass not only the Senate but also the House of Representatives in the U.S. soon. On the other hand, as AI (Artificial Intelligence)-related stocks, which had been bought temporarily, lost momentum, the market saw volatile movements, turning downward in the afternoon. Major general contractors such as Kajima Corporation and Taisei Corporation, which revised their earnings and dividend forecasts upward, surged in the afternoon. Meanwhile, declines were prominent in some semiconductor stocks like Advantest and Fujikura, and wire and cable stocks. KOKUSAI ELECTRIC, which revised its earnings forecast downward during trading hours, plummeted towards the end of trading.

[Today's Featured Stocks]
◆Shiseido (4911) 2,562.5 yen (-23.0 yen)
Operating loss for the cumulative third quarter (January-September) of the fiscal year ending December 2025 was 33.3 billion yen (compared to a 2.1 billion yen profit in the same period of the previous year). An unexpected loss was incurred due to impairment in the Americas business, but sales improved both domestically and internationally, and core operating profit, excluding temporary factors, increased by 9.7% year-on-year to 30 billion yen, exceeding market expectations. The company stated that structural reforms are progressing smoothly and expressed confidence in achieving the targets set in its medium-term management plan. It seems to have been perceived as all bad news being priced in, and the stock price saw moments of significant rise.

◆Sony Group (6758) 4,520 yen (+236 yen)
Announced financial results for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 at noon today. Operating profit increased by 20.4% year-on-year to 768.9 billion yen, exceeding market expectations. Furthermore, the full-year plan was revised upward from 1.33 trillion yen to 1.43 trillion yen (a 12.0% increase year-on-year). In addition to the music business, which benefited from the movie ""Demon Slayer,"" image sensors for mobile devices, where unit prices for new products for major customers increased and shipment volumes exceeded expectations, seem to be performing well.

◆Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012) 10,685 yen (-695 yen)
Pre-tax profit for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 increased by 49.0% year-on-year to 35.3 billion yen, a double-digit increase, but fell short of market expectations. The full-year plan for net sales was revised upward from 2.29 trillion yen to 2.34 trillion yen (a 9.9% increase year-on-year), but profits were kept at a level below market expectations, considering the impact of tariffs. Order intake was also revised upward, driven by an increase in aircraft engines for the Ministry of Defense and commercial aircraft, but this seems to have been perceived as unsatisfactory.

●【2】Tuesday Corner ""Investment & Money Questions"" What happens to taxes when you sell gold?
(Question) I want to sell the pure gold I've been accumulating, how will it be taxed?
(Answer) If the annual profit from sale is 500,000 yen or less, it is tax-exempt. If it exceeds 500,000 yen, the taxable amount changes depending on the holding period!

""Gold"" is attracting attention due to soaring prices. Many people, like the questioner, are likely considering selling to realize profits. However, if you are accumulating pure gold, or holding physical gold such as bullion or jewelry, taxation upon sale is somewhat complex. The two main points are: ① whether the sale ""profit"" is 500,000 yen or less, and ② whether the holding period is more than 5 years. Let's check below.

Profits from selling gold held in forms such as pure gold accumulation, bullion, or jewelry are classified as capital gains. First, calculate the profit from sale by subtracting (acquisition cost + selling fees) from the sale price. If you sell multiple times within a year, sum them up to calculate the total annual profit from sale. From that, subtract the special deduction for capital gains of 500,000 yen, and the remaining amount is subject to taxation. In other words, if the profit from sale is 500,000 yen or less, it becomes tax-exempt due to the special deduction, and a tax return is not required. This is point ①. For those who want to save on taxes, one strategy is to divide the selling timing across different years to keep the annual profit from sale within 500,000 yen.

If the profit from sale exceeds 500,000 yen, the amount that could not be fully deducted by the special deduction becomes taxable. What needs to be checked here is point ②: ""Is the holding period more than 5 years?"" If the gold holding period is more than 5 years, it is classified as ""long-term capital gains,"" and the taxable amount is reduced by half. Expressed as a formula, the taxable amount becomes: {Sale Price - (Acquisition Cost + Selling Fees) - Special Deduction of 500,000 yen} ÷ 2. On the other hand, if the holding period is 5 years or less, it is classified as ""short-term capital gains,"" and there is no reduction measure for the taxable amount. If the gold being sold includes both short-term and long-term holdings, calculate the taxable income for short-term and long-term separately, and then sum them up. Note that the special deduction of 500,000 yen is for both short-term and long-term combined. If short-term and long-term are mixed, it is applied preferentially to the calculation of short-term capital gains.

Capital gains from gold are subject to comprehensive taxation, and a tax return is required. The calculated taxable amount is combined with other income, such as employment income, to determine the tax rate. As can be understood from the explanation so far, calculating the taxable amount requires knowing the gold's acquisition date (for determining the holding period) and acquisition cost. When purchasing gold or jewelry at a store, be sure to keep necessary records such as proof of purchase or receipts. In cases where the acquisition cost is unknown, such as when gold is acquired through inheritance, it is common to calculate ""5% of the sale price"" as the deemed acquisition cost. In other cases, if there is a reasonable and objectively explainable reason, such as determining the year of manufacture from the number engraved on the gold and using the lowest retail price from that year onward as the deemed acquisition cost, it may be accepted. For how to handle cases where the acquisition cost is unknown, it is advisable to consult with a tax office or a tax accountant. Furthermore, if the sale price of gold exceeds 2 million yen, submission of a My Number Card to the buyer is mandatory, and the transaction record will also be shared by the buyer with the tax office. This means that if you do not file a tax return, there is a high probability that the tax office will point out an undeclared income. Even if it's a bit troublesome, if a taxable amount arises from the sale of gold, be sure to declare it.

After the close of trading on the 10th, in conjunction with the announcement of its consolidated financial results for the third quarter cumulative period (January-September) of the fiscal year ending December 2025, the company revised its full-year earnings forecast downward. In addition to reducing its sales forecast for the current fiscal year by 30 billion yen from the previous outlook to 965 billion yen (down 2.6% year-on-year), the company revised its net income forecast from a 6 billion yen profit to a 52 billion yen loss (compared to a 10.813 billion yen loss in the previous fiscal year). Reversing from a forecast of returning to profitability, the company now anticipates an expansion of its net loss. Following the announcement, the company's shares opened lower, but investors, perceiving that all negative factors had been exhausted, engaged in dip buying. Inbound consumption in Japan and a slowdown in the U.S. market are having an impact, and the delayed recovery of ""Drunk Elephant"" is also depressing profits. Due to the decline in profitability of its Americas business, the company will also record impairment losses on goodwill. The company also decided to implement a voluntary retirement program, including some domestic subsidiaries.

The company announced on the 10th that it has revised its consolidated net income forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026 from a previous profit of 36 billion yen to a loss of 17 billion yen (compared to a profit of 45.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year). Construction work on the metaxylylenediamine production facility of its Dutch subsidiary has been temporarily suspended due to a deterioration in the business environment. As a result of evaluating the recoverable amount of the fixed assets of the subsidiary based on this situation, an impairment loss will be recorded. This is expected to lead to a net loss. Consolidated net income for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was a loss of 27.9 billion yen (compared to a profit of 24.7 billion yen in the same period of the previous year). This was impacted by the decline in market prices for engineering plastics and methanol, an increase in fixed costs associated with strengthening production capacity at its Taiwan base for semiconductor chemicals, and the recording of an impairment loss at its Dutch subsidiary. ★9:00 Kose - Sell-off indication: 3Q cumulative operating profit down 28%, impacted by increased marketing costs and other factors Kose is showing a sell-off indication. The company announced on the 10th that its consolidated operating profit for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was 13.6 billion yen (down 27.8% year-on-year). The market consensus was 16.8 billion yen. While sales decreased in Greater China and Kose Cosmeport, overall sales increased due to significant growth in sales of 'Cosme Decorte' and Albion in Japan. On the other hand, profit decreased due to increased administrative expenses, including goodwill amortization for newly consolidated Purely, and increased marketing and logistics costs for Tarte. ★9:00 Pixel - Sell-off indication: 8.4 billion yen raised through new shares and stock acquisition rights, to be allocated to capital investment Pixel Companies is showing a sell-off indication. The company announced on the 10th the issuance of new shares and the 16th series of stock acquisition rights through a third-party allotment.

The payment due date for the new share issuance is December 10. The number of shares issued is 46.75 million shares. The issue price is 40 yen per share. Payment for the new share issuance will be made by way of contribution of monetary claims (debt-equity swap). The allotment date for the stock acquisition rights is December 10. The total number issued is 1,732,500 units (potential shares: 173.25 million shares). The exercise price is 40 yen.

The company announced on the 10th that its consolidated net income for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 58.1 billion yen (up 16.1% year-on-year). The market consensus was 64.8 billion yen. In the residential business, significant profit growth was achieved due to increased profits from domestic condominiums. Capital gains are expected to be recorded mainly in the second half, and progress is as planned. The stock price is predominantly selling due to the results falling below the consensus forecast. ★9:01 Shiseido - Sell-off indication: Full-year net loss of 52 billion yen expected, turning to a loss, impacted by impairment loss on Americas business Shiseido is showing a sell-off indication. The company announced on the 10th that it has revised its consolidated net income forecast (IFRS) for the full fiscal year ending December 2025 from a previous profit of 6 billion yen to a loss of 52 billion yen (compared to a loss of 10.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year). The market consensus was a profit of 8 billion yen. As a result of impairment tests conducted due to the decline in profitability of the Americas business, an impairment loss of 46.8 billion yen on goodwill was recorded, leading to results falling below the previous forecast. Consolidated net income for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was a loss of 44 billion yen (compared to a profit of 800 million yen in the same period of the previous year). Sales decreased mainly in the China and Travel Retail businesses, which continued to be affected by declining consumption due to worsening economic sentiment, and the Americas business, where 'Drunk Elephant' continued to struggle. The recording of an impairment loss on goodwill in the third quarter also had an impact. The company also announced the implementation of a voluntary retirement program, 'Next Career Support Plan.' The estimated number of participants is around 200. Expenses such as special severance payments arising from the implementation of this program are estimated to be around 3 billion yen and are planned to be recorded as non-recurring items in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025.

The consolidated net profit/loss for the most recent three-month period, the July-September quarter (Q3), fell to a 53.5 billion yen deficit (compared to a 730 million yen profit in the same period last year), and the sales operating profit margin sharply deteriorated from 2.3% in the same period last year to -23.0%.",Stock Search News,2025-11-10,Negative,Diverged,1.5519571135089905,-1.2998354511793253,Diverged,T+1,Medium,2585.5,0.5639828860365617,3479.0,0.6946454413892909,-0.1306625553527292,1.9447685725398678,-1.354444868370851,-0.057454754380925024,0.0,0.881028514660913,-0.4578142510883692,2562.5,-0.8895764842390254,3481.0,0.057487783845932734,-0.9470642680849581,-3.867723844517502,3.0979682156507744,-0.5428571428571428,0.0,4.367880727326539,13.175446748189431

This was primarily due to a decrease in sales of optical devices in the Semiconductor & Electronics business, which led to a decline in both revenue and profit.
In addition, the company announced that the previously undecided year-end dividend forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 would be 25 yen (25 yen at the end of the previous fiscal year). The annual dividend forecast is 50 yen (45 yen for the previous fiscal year).

The allotment date for both is November 25. The total number issued is 40,000 units (10th series: 30,000 units, 11th series: 10,000 units). The number of potential shares is 4 million shares.

At the briefing after the financial results announcement, Daiwa mentioned that due to the significant burden of steel and aluminum tariffs, an estimate was presented that the impact of US tariffs, on a net basis including countermeasures such as price increases, would be approximately 120 billion yen next fiscal year, compared to 55 billion yen this fiscal year. While continuous price pass-through is being considered, the fact that US Caterpillar is not very aggressive in raising prices at present is one of the concerns. Daiwa's forecast assumes this burden to be 55 billion yen this fiscal year and 115 billion yen next fiscal year, with segment profit projected to be 530 billion yen this fiscal year (company plan: 505 billion yen) and 478 billion yen next fiscal year.

Market consensus was 114.2 billion yen. Progress against the full-year company plan was 69.6%.

Revenue increased due to growth in the Toy and Hobby business and stable performance in the Amusement business. On the other hand, each profit item remained in decline, affected by factors such as a decrease in profit margin due to reduced sales of repeat titles in the Digital business, and a reactionary decline following the success of multiple theatrical releases in the Visual and Music business during the same period of the previous year. Net sales: 643,816 million yen (up 5.3% year-on-year), Operating profit: 105,481 million yen (down 7.2% year-on-year), Ordinary profit: 110,196 million yen (down 4.6% year-on-year), Net profit: 78,909 million yen (down 2.3% year-on-year). The situation for each main segment is as follows.

① Toy and Hobby Business: Net sales: 317,830 million yen (up 9.0% year-on-year), Segment profit: 65,035 million yen (up 8.9% year-on-year). Despite being partially affected by tariffs, the business performed strongly due to the expansion of product categories and lineups both domestically and internationally, the expansion of customer touchpoints through real events and stores, and the strengthening of production systems and distribution. Specifically, products for high-target (adult) demographics, such as Gunpla (plastic models from the Gundam series), collector's figures, and Ichiban Kuji (character lottery), performed well due to strengthened sales and marketing efforts and an expanded product lineup. Additionally, card products such as trading card games, Gashapon (capsule toys), and confectionery/food products contributed to performance through the expansion of product lineups, target demographics, and operating regions, as well as the strengthening of customer touchpoints. Furthermore, Tamagotchi-related products, including the new product ""Tamagotchi Paradise,"" gained popularity both domestically and internationally.

② Digital Business: Net sales: 231,504 million yen (up 1.3% year-on-year), Segment profit: 37,386 million yen (down 16.4% year-on-year). In network content, the new app title ""SD Gundam G Generation Eternal"" performed strongly, attracting new fan demographics. Additionally, major app titles such as the ""DRAGON BALL"" series, ""ONE PIECE,"" and ""THE IDOLM@STER"" series performed stably due to continuous initiatives targeting users. In home video games, the new title ""ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN"" was a worldwide hit, and ""Tamagotchi no Puchi Puchi Omisechi Omachido~sama!"" gained popularity due to synergistic buzz with the Toy and Hobby business. On the other hand, differences in the composition of home video game titles affected performance, such as a decrease in sales volume of repeat titles compared to the same period of the previous year. The Digital business will continue to aim for title development that prioritizes quality and meets fan expectations, and will work to build a balanced and optimal title portfolio.

③ Visual and Music Business (formerly IP Production Business): Net sales: 41,078 million yen (down 0.5% year-on-year), Segment profit: 5,359 million yen (down 20.2% year-on-year). The new visual work in the Gundam series, ""Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX,"" gained popularity by attracting new fan demographics in addition to existing fans, and contributed to performance through theatrical box office revenue, global video distribution, and licensing of products and services. Additionally, global expansion and video distribution of existing Gundam series and ""Blue Lock,"" among others, performed stably. Overall, the Visual and Music business did not reach the level of the same period of the previous year, when theatrical box office revenue from multiple hit theatrical releases significantly contributed to performance.

④ Amusement Business: Net sales: 75,380 million yen (up 5.2% year-on-year), Segment profit: 7,046 million yen (down 3.4% year-on-year). Existing store sales at domestic amusement facilities were 106.0% compared to the same period of the previous year. Additionally, Bandai Namco's unique facilities, such as ""Bandai Namco Cross Store"" and ""Gashapon Department Store,"" which are linked with the group's products and services, as well as activity facilities, performed strongly. In the sale of arcade games, ""Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. 2 Infinite Boost"" performed strongly. In the Amusement business, the role of fan touchpoints will be further strengthened to expand awareness of the group's products and services.

The consolidated financial forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026 has been revised upward simultaneously with the announcement of the Q2 financial results, as follows.

Deliveries of large-scale projects are progressing in the automotive, healthcare, and aerospace/infrastructure businesses, and the electronics business is also proceeding relatively smoothly. Although the situation remains uncertain, the company raised its full-year outlook due to stronger-than-initially-expected capital investment by manufacturing industries, which are its main customers. The annual dividend forecast will be 122 yen (92 yen in the previous fiscal year). Consolidated operating profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 6.59 billion yen (up 7.6% year-on-year). ★14:17 Fujifilm HD - Turned Negative in Afternoon Session, First-Half Operating Profit Up 17% but Hit by Profit-Taking Sales.

マネーフォワード<3994>が大幅続落。同社は4日、25.11期通期の連結営業損益予想を従来の47.0億円の赤字～23.0億円の赤字から48.0億円の赤字～24.0億円の赤字（前期は47.4億円の赤字）に下方修正すると発表した。市場コンセンサスは28.6億円の赤字。連結子会社であるスマートキャンプの全保有株式を譲渡したことにより、SaaS Marketingセグメント全体が連結の範囲から除外される大幅な事業ポートフォリオの変化が生じた。これにより、業績予想を見直した。
★9:32　 ＯＳＧ－大和が目標株価引き上げ　還元強化の意向はポジティブも収益力改善は途上
ＯＳＧ<6136>が続落。大和証券では、還元強化の意向はポジティブも収益力改善は途上と判断。投資判断「3（中立）」を継続、目標株価を1800円→2200円と引き上げた。大和では、直近の株価は「今期見込みを含めて3期にわたり配当性向は40％超過のため、来期以降の方針変更を検討中」とされたことでPBR:1倍を意識した上昇が続いてきたが、27.11期予想ROEを考慮すれば同PER:10倍程度（同予想EPS219円）を上回る評価は想定し難いと判断。現中期計画のキーワードは「Beyond」。過去のM&A効果もあり製品/地域のバランスは取れつつあり、今後は過去にない収益力（営業利益率16％超、ROE10％超）への改善を目指す計画。初年度はスロースタートだが、需要の増減を吸収できるシナリオ構築が待たれると指摘している。
★9:35　 日立建機－急落　日立が同社株を売却へ　11月7日予定
日立建機<6305>が急落。日立製作所<6501>は4日、同社株式を一部売却すると発表した。売却株数は保有する5406万2310株（議決権所有割合：25.4％）のうち1500万株（7.1％）。売却予定日は11月7日。ゴールドマン・サックス証券および大和証券を共同幹事証券として国内外の機関投資家に売却する。同売却により同社は日立製作所の持分法適用会社ではなくなる予定。株価は日立の売却による需給への影響を懸念した売りが優勢となっている。
★9:36　 ニデック－大幅続伸　総額6000億円のコミットメントライン契約を締結
ニデック<6594>が大幅続伸。同社は4日、主要取引銀行である三菱ＵＦＪ銀行および三井住友銀行との間で総額6000億円のコミットメントライン（融資枠）契約を締結したと発表した。借入極度額はそれぞれ3000億円。契約期間は2025年11月7日～26年11月6日となる。
★9:37　 アルメディオ－急落　通期営業損益を下方修正　一転赤字へ
アルメディオ<7859>が急落。同社は4日時、26.3期通期の連結営業損益予想を従来の2.8億円の黒字から6.6億円の赤字（前期は8.7億円の黒字）に下方修正すると発表した。断熱材事業において、中国子会社で下期からの受注を予定していた太陽光発電パネル製造向け拡散炉用ヒーターモジュール等の販売量が計画を下回っていることなどを踏まえた。26.3期2Q（4-9月）の連結営業損益は3.4億円の赤字（前年同期は6.3億円の黒字）だった。
★9:43　 トーシンＨＤ－新安値　前期最終赤字転落　今期予想は非開示
トーシンホールディングス<9444>が新安値。同社は4日、25.4期通期の連結純損益は0.8億円の赤字（前の期は1.4億円の黒字）だったと発表した。第三者委員会の調査により、同社における不適切な会計処理の事実が明らかになった。過年度決算訂正費用として特別損失を計上したことなどにより、最終赤字となった。26.4期の業績予想は非開示。現時点において合理的な業績予想の算定が困難であるためとしている。なお、不適切な会計処理の調査などに時間を要したため、同社は決算発表を延期していた。","★9:30 Money Forward - Sharp Continued Decline; Full-Year Operating Profit/Loss Revised Downward, Reflecting Sale of Consolidated Subsidiary Shares
Money Forward <3994> continued its sharp decline. The company announced on the 4th that it has revised downward its consolidated operating loss forecast for the full fiscal year ending November 2025 from the previous range of 4.70 billion yen to 2.30 billion yen in losses, to a new range of 4.80 billion yen to 2.40 billion yen in losses (compared to a 4.74 billion yen loss in the previous fiscal year). The market consensus was a 2.86 billion yen loss. Due to the transfer of all shares held in its consolidated subsidiary, SmartCamp, a significant change in the business portfolio occurred, resulting in the entire SaaS Marketing segment being excluded from the scope of consolidation. Consequently, the earnings forecast was revised.
★9:32 OSG - Daiwa Raises Target Price; Intention to Strengthen Shareholder Returns Positive, but Profitability Improvement Still in Progress
OSG <6136> continued its decline. Daiwa Securities judged that while the intention to strengthen shareholder returns is positive, the improvement in profitability is still in progress. It maintained its ""3 (Neutral)"" investment rating and raised its target price from 1,800 yen to 2,200 yen. Daiwa judged that although the recent stock price has continued to rise, driven by awareness of a PBR of 1x due to the statement ""dividend payout ratio has exceeded 40% for three consecutive periods, including the current fiscal year's estimate, and a change in policy for the next fiscal year and beyond is under consideration,"" it is difficult to expect a valuation exceeding a PER of around 10x (with an estimated EPS of 219 yen) when considering the estimated ROE for the fiscal year ending November 2027. The keyword for the current medium-term plan is ""Beyond."" With the effects of past M&A, the balance of products/regions is being achieved, and the plan is to aim for an unprecedented improvement in profitability (operating profit margin exceeding 16%, ROE exceeding 10%). It pointed out that while the first year is a slow start, the development of a scenario that can absorb fluctuations in demand is awaited.
★9:35 Hitachi Construction Machinery - Plunges; Hitachi to Sell Company Shares, Scheduled for November 7
Hitachi Construction Machinery <6305> plunged. Hitachi Ltd. <6501> announced on the 4th that it would sell a portion of its shares in the company. The number of shares to be sold is 15 million shares (7.1% of voting rights) out of the 54,062,310 shares it holds (25.4% of voting rights). The scheduled sale date is November 7. The shares will be sold to institutional investors both domestically and internationally, with Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. and Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. acting as joint lead managers. As a result of this sale, the company is expected to cease being an equity-method affiliate of Hitachi Ltd. Selling pressure is dominant, driven by concerns over the impact on supply and demand from Hitachi's sale.
★9:36 Nidec - Sharp Continued Rise; Concludes Commitment Line Agreement Totaling 600 Billion Yen
Nidec <6594> continued its sharp rise. The company announced on the 4th that it has concluded a commitment line (credit facility) agreement totaling 600 billion yen with its main transaction banks, MUFG Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The maximum borrowing amount is 300 billion yen for each bank. The contract period is from November 7, 2025, to November 6, 2026.
★9:37 Almedio - Plunges; Full-Year Operating Profit/Loss Revised Downward, Turning to Loss
Almedio <7859> plunged. The company announced on the 4th that it has revised downward its consolidated operating profit/loss forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026 from the previous 280 million yen profit to a 660 million yen loss (compared to an 870 million yen profit in the previous fiscal year). This revision is based on factors such as sales volumes of heater modules for diffusion furnaces used in solar panel manufacturing, which were expected to be ordered from the second half of the fiscal year by its Chinese subsidiary in the insulation material business, falling below plan. The consolidated operating profit/loss for the second quarter (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 was a 340 million yen loss (compared to a 630 million yen profit in the same period of the previous year).
★9:43 Toshin Holdings - Hits New Low; Net Loss in Previous Fiscal Year, Current Fiscal Year Forecast Undisclosed
Toshin Holdings <9444> hit a new low. The company announced on the 4th that its consolidated net profit/loss for the full fiscal year ending April 2025 was an 80 million yen loss (compared to a 140 million yen profit in the previous fiscal year). An investigation by a third-party committee revealed facts of inappropriate accounting treatment within the company. As a result of recording extraordinary losses as expenses for correcting past financial statements, among other factors, the company fell into a net loss. The earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending April 2026 is undisclosed. This is because it is difficult to reasonably calculate an earnings forecast at this time. Furthermore, the company had postponed its financial results announcement due to the time required for the investigation into the inappropriate accounting treatment.",Traders Web,2025-11-05,Neutral,Neutral,0.83552353072994,6.637974555845052,Neutral,T+1,Weak,4998.0,-4.271212411415438,3426.0,-1.3532968615030232,-2.917915549912415,-1.915341888527102,-2.401874633860574,-0.37801686536783946,-1.7035873428088564,1.4812950896487012,1.0239289371485931,5201.0,4.061624649859944,3472.0,1.3426736719206072,2.7189509779393366,4.041616646658664,0.019230769230769232,0.37583116507661174,1.1006026944520082,1.2634159567977947,0.5728208112487605

Lines' downward revision; Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha also trading lower. NYK Line <9101> saw a sharp fall in the afternoon session. This is due to negative sentiment following Mitsui O.S.K. Lines <9104> announcing at 12:00 on the 4th that it has revised its consolidated net profit forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026 downward from the previous 200 billion yen to 180 billion yen (a 57.7% decrease year-on-year). The container shipping business is expected to fall below previous forecasts, and net profit is planned to be below market consensus. Reacting negatively to this, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines started the afternoon session with selling pressure. NYK Line, as a joint venture company with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha <9107>, has Ocean Network Express (ONE), which operates container ships, under its umbrella. As Mitsui O.S.K.

This revision is based on the first-half performance in the beauty care, healthcare, and fine chemical sectors of wool grease derivatives, primarily in the functional products field. Consolidated operating profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 2.98 billion yen (a 24.2% increase year-on-year). In addition, the company announced the cancellation of 1.55 million treasury shares. The scheduled cancellation date is November 20. The ratio to the total outstanding shares before cancellation will be 6.1%. ★12:51 MODEC - SMBC Nikko raises target price; focusing on improved profitability of EPCI from the second half of FY12/25 onwards. MODEC <6269> traded slightly higher. SMBC Nikko Securities is focusing on improved profitability of EPCI from the second half of the fiscal year ending December 2025 onwards. They maintained their investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised their target price from 3,300 yen to 9,500 yen. SMBC Nikko forecasts operating profit for the fiscal year ending December 2025 to be $431.2 million, exceeding the company's plan of $410 million. From the second half of the fiscal year ending December 2025, they expect efficient sales acceleration utilizing new bases for EPCI projects (Gato do Mato, Hammerhead) ordered this year. In O&M, as major maintenance on chartered vessels settles down, they have incorporated an improvement in profitability, with the first-half operating profit margin of 8.3% rising to a second-half forecast of 11.6%. They commented that from the second half of the fiscal year ending December 2025 onwards, profitability improvement can also be expected as operations utilizing new bases accelerate for newly ordered EPCI projects this fiscal year. For further evaluation, they stated that they want to confirm an increase in order size utilizing capacity expansion, changes in shareholder return policy, etc. ★12:51 Nitto Denko - SMBC Nikko raises target price; demonstrating strength in high-end applications. Nitto Denko <6988> slightly extended its gains. SMBC Nikko Securities pointed out its strength in high-end applications. They maintained their investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised their target price from 3,000 yen to 3,700 yen. SMBC Nikko updated its earnings forecasts based on financial results and interviews. They noted the materialization of contributions from large projects in nucleic acid drug CDMO, in addition to strong device demand from key customers. They believe there is a high possibility of a share buyback announcement at the time of the Q3 earnings release. Based on the FCF outlook, they assume a scale of 50 billion yen (previously: 30 billion yen). They forecast operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 2027 to increase by 12% year-on-year, driven by new applications for high-precision substrates, automotive polarizing films, CDMO, and electrically peelable tapes. They expect the company to update its record-high profits. However, judging from consensus profit levels and valuation metrics, they believe expectations in the stock market are also high. ★12:53 Nexela Pharma - Sharply fell for 5 consecutive days; cumulative Q3 net loss expanded; impacted by increased R&D expenses, etc. Nexela Pharma <4565> sharply fell for 5 consecutive days. The company announced on October 31 that its consolidated net loss for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was 4.81 billion yen (compared to a loss of 3.50 billion yen in the same period last year). This was impacted by increased cost of sales and R&D expenses, and deterioration in financial balance. ★13:06 HOYA - Morgan Stanley MUFG raises target price; HDD glass substrates to be the biggest growth driver in 2026-27. HOYA <7741> fell back. Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities commented that HDD glass substrates will be the biggest growth driver in 2026-27. They maintained their investment rating at ""Equal-weight"" and raised their target price from 20,000 yen to 23,000 yen. Morgan Stanley raised its EPS forecast for FY25-27 by approximately 4%, based on the increase in 3.5-inch substrates in July-September and the growth of video-related products. They forecast the growth rate of 3.5-inch glass substrates to be in the low teens annually for FY25-26, accelerating to the high teens in FY27 due to contributions from shipments to two new customers. They expect the profitability of healthcare, which was low in July-September, to improve to approximately 20% from FY26 onwards, which is the company's guideline. On the other hand, while the fundamental outlook is good, they believe the stock price has already factored in expectations for HDD glass substrate growth until around 2027.",Traders Web,2025-11-04,Positive,Aligned,1.752489797609274,3.980979430149008,Aligned,T+1,Medium,25140.0,0.21925453458241975,3473.0,-0.5441008018327605,0.7633553364151803,-7.9728921666334465,8.901884340480832,-0.3157290470723306,0.0,1.5316980127750177,1.7392313201195977,24800.0,-1.352426412092283,3426.0,-1.3532968615030232,0.000870449410740104,-0.11933174224343676,-1.2345679012345678,-0.37801686536783946,-0.9297551127076412,1.2820281264623543,0.903559803042499

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 40.75 dollars from the previous day at 47,562.87 dollars, and the Nasdaq closed up 143.82 points at 23,724.96. The Nikkei 225 night session closed down 190 yen from the daytime closing price at 52,280 yen. Amazon, which announced strong financial results, surged, leading to spillover effects on other AI-related stocks and a solid, tech-led performance. On the other hand, several officials from the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) expressed caution about further interest rate cuts, which curbed upside potential. The Japan-US summit meeting was seen as a success for the Takaichi administration, leading to further heightened policy expectations. Furthermore, the US-China summit meeting, including agreements on US tariff reductions on China and a temporary suspension of China's rare earth export restrictions, has brought a sense of relief to the market. Moreover, the additional interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan, which some had been wary of, was also postponed, giving the impression that this week was generally filled with positive news. With the psychological milestone of 50,000 yen being broken through rapidly, overheating concerns are also strengthening. In the absence of major events, we should consider the possibility that a sense of having exhausted positive news and a feeling of accomplishment may prevail in the short term. Domestically, financial results announcements for the July-September quarter are in full swing, and next week's market is likely to shift to a focus on individual stock selections. Among these, the notable financial results announcements will be Toyota Motor on the 5th, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on the 7th, and Fujikura. Toyota's financial results will provide insight into the impact of US tariffs and are expected to influence the trends of automotive-related stocks and US export-related stocks. The trends following Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' financial results announcement are expected to strengthen the direction of defense-related stocks and shipbuilding stocks. Fujikura's financial results, depending on their evaluation, are also likely to impact other wire and cable stocks, as well as AI-related and data center-related stocks. The US government shutdown has been prolonged, raising concerns about its negative impact on the economy. Furthermore, the currently debated budget bill is a stopgap measure until November 21st, so even if it passes Congress, another government shutdown could occur afterward. Many important economic indicators, such as employment statistics, have also been postponed, leaving some sense of unease about the stock market's rise amidst these circumstances. The employment statistics scheduled for the 7th are highly likely to be postponed, and no significant events are planned in overseas markets next week either. Among these, the ISM Manufacturing PMI, which has been below 50 (the expansion/contraction threshold) for seven consecutive months, and the ADP Employment Report, which is gaining attention as an alternative indicator to employment statistics, will be watched. Compared to this week, there are few US corporate earnings announcements next week that are likely to have a strong market impact. In the semiconductor sector, Arm (UK) is scheduled to announce results, in addition to AMD, Super Micro, Qualcomm, and others. Regarding Arm, there is a possibility of spillover effects on domestic stocks through SoftBank Group's share price. Overall, US corporate earnings have had a positive impact on the stock market, and the completion of earnings announcements will lead to a decrease in factors pushing up stock prices.■Foreign Exchange Market Outlook Will the USD/JPY struggle to gain next week? While the cautious stance on accommodative monetary policy in the US and the receding expectations for a December rate hike in Japan tend to push the dollar higher and the yen lower, increased pressure for exchange rate adjustments could lead to a heavy upside. The US Federal Reserve Board (FRB) decided on an additional interest rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on October 28-29, as expected. However, it showed a cautious stance on future accommodative policy. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan maintained its current monetary policy at the Monetary Policy Meeting on October 29-30 and also took a passive stance on future tightening policies. However, with the postponement of important US economic indicators and a lack of clues, risk-on sentiment is unlikely to spread, and dollar buying/yen selling may be somewhat curbed. On the 28th, the US Treasury Department issued a statement emphasizing that 'sound monetary policy formulation and communication play a crucial role in maintaining stable inflation expectations and preventing excessive exchange rate volatility.' Furthermore, Finance Minister Katayama stated at a press conference on the morning of the 31st, regarding the USD/JPY reaching the 154 yen level in the foreign exchange market, that he is 'observing excessive fluctuations and disorderly movements in the foreign exchange market, including speculative trends, with a high sense of vigilance.' There is a view that the US Treasury Department's statement aimed to curb excessive yen depreciation, and Finance Minister Katayama has expressed concern about the yen's depreciation. If expectations for an early rate hike by the Bank of Japan emerge in addition to these developments, it could put downward pressure on the USD/JPY exchange rate.■Next Week's Key Schedule November 3 (Mon): Stock market closed due to public holiday (Culture Day), US ISM Manufacturing PMI (Oct), US Construction Spending (Sep), US Manufacturing PMI (Oct), US Auto Sales (Oct, by 4th), China RatingDog Manufacturing PMI (Oct), Eurozone Manufacturing PMI (Oct), Germany Manufacturing PMI (Oct), Switzerland Consumer Price Index (Oct), Hong Kong Financial Summit (until 5th), etc. November 4 (Tue): Representative Interpellations regarding Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's policy speech in the Plenary Session of the House of Representatives, Manufacturing PMI (Oct), US Trade Balance (Sep), US JOLTS Job Openings (Sep), US Factory Orders (Sep), Europe ECB President Lagarde delivers keynote speech and holds press conference, Australia Reserve Bank of Australia (Central Bank) announces policy interest rate, Canada Trade Balance (Sep), etc. November 5 (Wed): Representative Interpellations regarding Prime Minister Takaichi's policy speech in Plenary Sessions of Both Houses of the Diet, BOJ Policy Board Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes (Sep 18-19), Monetary Base (Oct), US ADP National Employment Report (Oct), US ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Oct), US Services PMI (Oct), US Composite PMI (Oct), China RatingDog Services PMI (Oct), China RatingDog Composite PMI (Oct), Eurozone Producer Price Index (Sep), Eurozone Services PMI (Oct), Eurozone Composite PMI (Oct), Germany Factory Orders (Sep), NZ Unemployment Rate (Jul-Sep), Brazil Central Bank announces policy interest rate (SELIC rate), etc. November 6 (Thu): Representative Interpellations regarding Prime Minister Takaichi's policy speech in the Plenary Session of the House of Councillors, Monthly Labor Survey - Total Cash Earnings (Sep), Real Wage Total (Sep), Tokyo Office Vacancy Rate (Oct), Services PMI (Oct), Composite PMI (Oct), 30th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30, until 21st), US Initial Jobless Claims (previous week), US Nonfarm Productivity (Jul-Sep), US Wholesale Inventories (Sep), Eurozone Retail Sales (Sep), Germany Industrial Production Index (Sep), UK Bank of England (Central Bank) announces policy interest rate, Australia Trade Balance (Sep), Switzerland Unemployment Rate (Oct), Mexico Central Bank announces policy interest rate, etc. November 7 (Fri): Household Spending (Sep), US Nonfarm Payrolls (Oct), US Unemployment Rate (Oct), US Average Hourly Earnings (Oct), US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (preliminary, Nov), US Consumer Credit (Sep), US NY Fed 1-Year Inflation Expectation (Oct), China Foreign Exchange Reserves (Oct), China Current Account Balance (preliminary, Jul-Sep), China Trade Balance (Oct), Canada Unemployment Rate (Oct), etc. November 9 (Sun): China Consumer Price Index (Oct), China Producer Price Index (Oct), China Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (Oct, by 15th), China Money Supply (Oct, by 15th), China New Yuan-denominated Loans (Oct, by 15th), etc.",Fisco,2025-11-01,Neutral,Aligned,-0.5571773177290472,-2.2704204375738146,Aligned,T+1,Weak,3155.0,0.5417463352453792,3473.0,-0.5441008018327605,1.0858471370781397,0.3824091778202677,0.15873015873015872,-0.3157290470723306,-0.019890397070590232,1.0974187732502036,0.25554176985259336,3040.0,-3.6450079239302693,3426.0,-1.3532968615030232,-2.291711062427246,-0.15847860538827258,-3.492063492063492,-0.37801686536783946,-2.3319406054980805,2.2580384162327025,3.5093538252412526

Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. On the other hand, the theoretical stock price indicates the intrinsic corporate value, with the expectation factor removed. A stock price lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, but this alone does not guarantee a price increase. More importantly, it is whether the theoretical stock price will rise in future financial results. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (indicating expectations), the stock price will also tend to rise in conjunction. Conversely, stocks where expectations have run too far ahead and the stock price significantly exceeds the theoretical stock price carry the risk of a sharp decline if performance commensurate with the stock price is not demonstrated in financial results (if expectations shrink).

The higher the earnings evaluation, the easier it is for the stock price to rise. ○About Theoretical Stock Price Web Theoretical Stock Price Web calculates the theoretical stock price for all stocks using the 'Hasshan-style Theoretical Stock Price' method. Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. On the other hand, the theoretical stock price indicates the intrinsic corporate value, removing the element of expectations. While a stock price lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. More importantly, it is whether the theoretical stock price will rise in future earnings reports. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (indicating expectations), the stock price will also tend to rise in conjunction. Conversely, stocks where expectations have run too far ahead, causing the stock price to significantly exceed the theoretical stock price, carry the risk of a sharp decline if they fail to demonstrate performance commensurate with the stock price in their earnings reports (in cases where expectations shrink). If the theoretical stock price fluctuates significantly at the time of earnings announcements, it may present an opportunity for a level correction. ≪FA≫ FISCO Ltd.",Fisco,2025-10-31,Negative,Diverged,2.74816501713112,0.3111914849589841,Diverged,T+1,Strong,25085.0,3.5500515995872033,3492.0,0.9832272990167726,2.5668243005704308,2.063983488132095,1.456016177957533,0.08598452278589853,1.1830457525561664,2.0163217980734927,4.526968251386503,25140.0,0.21925453458241975,3473.0,-0.5441008018327605,0.7633553364151803,-7.9728921666334465,8.901884340480832,-0.3157290470723306,-0.32628393726694266,1.549367218104084,1.7989825930962313

Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. On the other hand, theoretical stock prices indicate the intrinsic corporate value, with the expectation factor removed. While a stock price being lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. More importantly, it is whether the theoretical stock price will rise in future earnings reports. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (indicating expectations), the stock price will also tend to rise in conjunction. Conversely, for stocks where expectations have run too far ahead and the stock price significantly exceeds the theoretical stock price, there is a risk of a sharp decline if performance commensurate with the stock price is not shown in earnings reports (if expectations shrink). If the theoretical stock price fluctuates significantly at the time of earnings announcements, it may present an opportunity for a level correction.",Fisco,2025-10-31,Negative,Diverged,10.375106199258925,11.586021745976618,Diverged,T+1,Strong,5650.0,6.6238913002453295,3492.0,0.9832272990167726,5.640664001228557,0.3963011889035667,6.203007518796992,0.08598452278589853,2.091085604409713,3.8080170699017826,5.643882526285162,6062.0,7.292035398230088,3473.0,-0.5441008018327605,7.836136200062849,12.389380530973451,-4.535433070866142,-0.3157290470723306,2.0936961246700796,5.015544412004745,5.833889000511606

Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. On the other hand, the theoretical stock price indicates the intrinsic corporate value, with the expectation factor removed. While a stock price being lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. What is more important is whether the theoretical stock price will rise in future earnings reports. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (with expectations), the stock price will also tend to rise in conjunction. Conversely, stocks where expectations have run too far ahead, causing the stock price to significantly exceed the theoretical stock price, carry the risk of a sharp decline if earnings reports do not show performance commensurate with the stock price (in cases where expectations shrink). If the theoretical stock price fluctuates significantly at the time of earnings announcements, it may present an opportunity for a level correction. <<FA>> FISCO Ltd.

This revision is based on a significant increase in orders for information systems in the first half, backed by a high level of defense budget, as well as steady progress in electronic equipment.

It maintained its ""Buy"" investment rating and raised its target price from 4,800 yen to 5,800 yen. The company's stock price has continued to rise for over three months, updating its all-time high recorded in January 2021. While there is a possibility that some may start recommending profit-taking given the current stock price level, the company's performance is still supported by the structural growth of its core businesses, and there is expected to be further upside potential in market consensus forecasts.

Net loss was 69.1 billion yen (compared to a profit of 197.3 billion yen in the same period last year). Market consensus was an operating profit of 106.6 billion yen and a net loss of 130.8 billion yen. Both the automotive business and the industrial, infrastructure, and IoT businesses saw an increase in revenue and an improvement in operating profit margin quarter-on-quarter. Year-on-year, operating profit decreased due to market softening, adjustment of distribution inventory, and lower utilization rates. The previously undecided Non-GAAP revenue forecast for the full fiscal year ending December 2025 was set at 1,300.1 billion yen to 1,315.1 billion yen (down 3.6% to 2.5% year-on-year). The assumed exchange rates are 149 yen to 1 US dollar and 167 yen to 1 Euro.

The company announced on the 28th that its consolidated operating profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 680 million yen (up 4.5 times year-on-year). Market consensus was 590 million yen. In the software business, sales of subscription-based licenses, which are a focus, were strong, and cloud-based services also performed steadily. In the services business, order-taking activities for peripheral services such as system development and consulting using ""intra-mart"" progressed favorably, and ongoing large-scale system development projects also proceeded smoothly. As a result, both businesses achieved increased revenue. The stock price, however, saw selling dominance as the news was priced in. ★9:18 Okinawa Cellular - SBI Raises Target Price; Early Phase of Price Revision, Towards a Lean Customer Base Okinawa Cellular Telephone <9436> rebounded for the first time in 4 days. SBI Securities judged that the company is in the early phase of price revision, moving towards a lean customer base. It maintained its ""Buy"" investment rating and raised its target price from 2,935 yen to 3,100 yen. It pointed out that the confirmed increase in ARPU through the new plan in June and the price revision in August is positive. Although the company is in a phase of net mobile subscriber reduction in the short term, a customer base of long-term users with high unit prices remains, giving the impression that a shift from quantity to quality is progressing. The total shareholder return yield is 4.5%, and based on the cash allocation policy under the current medium-term plan, continuous dividend increases and share buybacks are expected until the fiscal year ending March 2031. ★9:22 Toei Animation - Rebounds; First-Half Operating Profit Down 2.1%, but Exceeds Consensus Toei Animation <4816> rebounded. The company announced on the 29th that its consolidated operating profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 16.6 billion yen (down 2.1% year-on-year). Market consensus was 16.4 billion yen. Although revenue decreased due to a reactionary decline from strong domestic distribution rights sales for ""Slam Dunk"" and ""GeGeGe no Kitaro"" and merchandise sales of major works in the same period last year, the company stated that it maintained roughly the same level of profit, supported by strong overseas merchandising rights sales.

The higher the earnings evaluation, the more likely the stock price is to rise. ○About Theoretical Stock Price Web Theoretical Stock Price Web calculates the theoretical stock price for all stocks using the ""Hasshan Method Theoretical Stock Price"". Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. In contrast, the theoretical stock price indicates the intrinsic corporate value, with the expectation factor removed. While a stock price being lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. More importantly, it is whether the theoretical stock price will increase in future financial results. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (indicating positive expectations), the stock price is also likely to rise in conjunction. Conversely, for stocks where expectations have run too far ahead and the stock price significantly exceeds the theoretical stock price, there is a risk of a sharp decline if the financial results do not demonstrate performance commensurate with the stock price (in cases where expectations shrink).

Shin-Etsu Chemical continues to search for lower price levels. On the 7th of this month, there was a moment when its price of 5,263 yen approached its year-to-date high of 5,287 yen set in January, but since then, it has rapidly declined, and the current price is now below the 75-day moving average, which is a watershed for medium-to-long-term trends. The company's financial results for the April-September 2025 period showed sluggish performance, with operating profit down 18% year-on-year. The price of its main product, PVC resin, softened due to overproduction in China, which appears to have been a factor in depressing profits. However, there are observations that the market conditions for PVC resin will not deteriorate further. Furthermore, demand for AI-related applications is a tailwind for semiconductor silicon wafers, which constitute another pillar of revenue, and the prevailing view is that the company's earnings environment will change for the better in the current second half of the fiscal year. From a stock price perspective, the adjustment seems sufficient, and it appears that more investors are paying attention to it as a target for dip buying.

The growth rate expanded from a 37.4% increase to a 70.6% increase, further raising its forecast for a record high profit for two consecutive periods. Concurrently, the company announced a share buyback program with an upper limit of 18 million shares, representing 2.5% of outstanding shares, or 150 billion yen. Kinden <1944> [TSE Prime] Revised current fiscal year's ordinary profit up 24%, raised record high profit forecast, and increased dividend by 20 yen. Consolidated ordinary profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) surged 2.4 times year-on-year to 34.0 billion yen, exceeding the previous forecast of 24.0 billion yen. The improvement in project profitability, backed by a favorable market environment, coupled with progress in productivity improvements, led to the upward revision. Concurrently, the full-year profit forecast was revised upward by 23.6% from the previous forecast of 70.0 billion yen to 86.5 billion yen. The growth rate expanded from an 8.4% increase to a 34.0% increase, further raising its forecast for a record high profit for two consecutive periods.

The dividend policy was changed, raising the dividend payout ratio to 40% or more (previously 30% or more).

Consolidated ordinary profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was revised upward 3.5 times from the previous forecast of 0.6 billion yen to 2.1 billion yen. This reversed the previous forecast of a profit decrease, now projecting a 30.8% profit increase. Factors contributing to the upward revision include other income exceeding expectations, as well as the deferral of some expenses, such as program costs, to the third quarter and beyond. Realgate <5532> [TSE Growth] Current fiscal year's ordinary profit to increase 35%, marking 8 consecutive periods of record high profits.

For the current fiscal year, the company plans to maintain high occupancy rates for existing managed properties, continue to accumulate stable stock-type revenue, and sell two owned properties for flow-type revenue. Concurrently, the company announced a medium-term management plan aiming for an operating profit of 2.5 billion yen by the fiscal year ending September 2028 (actual result for the fiscal year ended September 2025 was 1.04 billion yen).

The rate of profit decrease is expected to shrink from 79.2% to 54.0%. Factors contributing to the upward revision include the resolution of the impact of soaring material costs in the tester field, research and development expenses being lower than expected, and the yen's exchange rate remaining weaker than anticipated. On the other hand, sales were revised downward due to sluggish inquiries and order conditions for testers. Concurrently, the company announced that it will cancel 200,000 shares, representing 3.46% of outstanding shares, on November 13.

Musashi <7521> [TSE Standard] Revised first-half ordinary profit up 58%, increased full-year forecast, and increased dividend by 10 yen. Consolidated ordinary profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was revised upward by 57.8% from the previous forecast of 1.5 billion yen to 2.37 billion yen.

Texcend starts fairly smoothly, but some underperformances and cancellations are seen ●[1] Today's Stock Market & Hot Stocks at a Glance! Breaks 51,000 yen for the first time! Advantest pushes it up by 1,077 yen [Today's Market] The Nikkei Stock Average rebounded sharply! It surpassed the 51,000 yen level for the first time. In the U.S. market on the 28th, technology stocks were bought, and major stock indices such as the NY Dow updated their record highs for consecutive days. Nvidia rose +4.98% following CEO Jensen Huang's speech at the 'GTC' developer conference. Furthermore, in today's Tokyo market, Advantest's earnings were well-received, and its stock hit the daily limit high with the highest trading value. This single stock pushed up the Nikkei Stock Average by approximately 1,077 yen. However, approximately 86% of stocks on the TSE Prime market declined, and the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) fell by -0.23%. While the strong performance of stocks benefiting from the spread of AI (Artificial Intelligence) stood out, stock reactions to the earnings of other companies were not necessarily favorable. The strengths and weaknesses of stocks are likely to become clearer after earnings announcements, so please refer to the explanations on promising themes and stocks in X (formerly Twitter)'s audio chat 'Spaces'. Furthermore, tonight in the U.S., attention will be on the results of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as well as the earnings of major tech companies such as Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.

After the close of trading on the 28th, the company announced its H1 (April-September) results for the fiscal year ending March 2026, with operating profit reaching 232.4 billion yen, 2.5 times higher than the same period last year. Furthermore, it revised its full-year operating profit forecast upward from the previous 300 billion yen to 374 billion yen (a 63.9% increase year-on-year). The interim dividend per share was set at 29 yen, 10 yen higher than the previous fiscal year, and the company plans to conduct a share buyback of up to 150 billion yen. Management indicators outlined in the medium-term management plan up to the fiscal year ending March 2027 were also revised upward. ◆Kindai Corporation (1944) 6,158 yen (+1,000 yen) A major electrical equipment construction company affiliated with Kansai Electric Power. Operating profit for H1 (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 reached 31.8 billion yen, 2.5 times higher than the same period last year, significantly exceeding the previous forecast (23 billion yen). Furthermore, it revised its full-year operating profit forecast upward from 67 billion yen to 81 billion yen (a 32.8% increase year-on-year) and increased its annual dividend forecast from 100 yen to 120 yen per share (60 yen for both interim and year-end). The new construction and expansion of data centers are believed to be a tailwind. ◆Obic (4684) 4,693 yen (-260 yen) The company announced its H1 (April-September) results for the fiscal year ending March 2026, with operating profit increasing by 13.0% year-on-year to 43.6 billion yen. Its core integrated business software (ERP) 'OBIC7 Series' continued to perform strongly. Although the results were described as good, the profit level was in line with market expectations and prior reports, so it seems to have been perceived as lacking surprise, leading to selling. ●[2] Wednesday Corner: ZAi Analyst Hirozumi Kobayashi's 'IPO Stock Insider Story' Texcend Starts Fairly Smoothly, But Some Underperformances and Cancellations Are Seen Today, let's review the results of October's IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) (for prior stock introductions, refer to the September 17th and October 1st issues). Nine companies were listed in October, but BJC, which was scheduled to be listed on the 28th, was postponed. Furthermore, Fine Today Holdings, scheduled for listing on November 5th, was postponed for the second time, following last year. Just before the decision to postpone, the stock market was volatile due to domestic politics, so it might have simply been bad timing. However, contrary to the strong performance of the overall stock market, investors may be becoming more selective about IPO stocks, or more severe about price fluctuation risks. The initial prices of the nine companies that managed to list were also not generally strong. While Texcend Photomask (public offering/secondary offering size of 156.6 billion yen), which attracted attention as a large IPO, had a fairly smooth start with a +19.0% increase from its offering price, three out of the nine companies were forced to start below their offering prices. Although Overlap Holdings (secondary offering size of 16.5 billion yen) and Infcurion (public offering/secondary offering size of 13 billion yen) were somewhat large IPOs (meaning they are prone to cash-out selling), which might be unavoidable to some extent, the aggressive stance seen in increasing the number of shares offered during the listing process makes the outcome somewhat disappointing. For the time being, there is a possibility that caution regarding stock supply and demand (balance between selling and buying) for IPOs of this size may strengthen. On the other hand, IPOs with a public offering/secondary offering size of several billion yen generally saw initial prices 20-40% higher than their offering prices, and Lion Office Products, with a size of just over 1 billion yen, had an initial price of +75.6%. The stock with relatively good price movement after its initial price was Usonar, which opened at 2,350 yen (+17.5%) against an offering price of 2,000 yen, and temporarily rose to 3,450 yen on the 24th. Although the price movement is somewhat volatile immediately after listing, growth expectations appear high. Next week, NE is scheduled to be listed on November 4th, and Classico on November 5th. Both are small IPOs with a public offering/secondary offering size of just over 400 million yen (meaning they are less prone to cash-out selling), and are the type whose initial prices tend to rise significantly. Other scheduled listings for November will be introduced on another occasion. It was also reported that SBI Shinsei Bank is aiming for a mid-December listing. Since details of the IPO are expected to be revealed within November, let's keep an eye on it. [Stock Pick] Usonar (431A) Listed on TSE Growth on October 17th. It opened at 2,350 yen, 17.5% above its offering price of 2,000 yen. It provides cloud services that utilize its proprietary corporate database to organize, integrate, and continuously update customer-owned databases. For the fiscal year ending December 2025, the company forecasts sales of 6.88 billion yen, a 13.3% increase year-on-year, and operating profit of 1.261 billion yen, a 38.5% increase.

After the close of trading on the 28th, the company revised upward its consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, with net sales from 835 billion yen to 950 billion yen (up 21.8% year-on-year), operating income from 300 billion yen to 374 billion yen (up 63.9% year-on-year), and net income from 221.5 billion yen to 275 billion yen (up 70.6% year-on-year). In addition, the interim dividend forecast, which had been undecided, was set at 29 yen (19 yen in the same period of the previous year), which was well received. Against the backdrop of further complexity, performance improvement, and increased production volume of AI-related semiconductors, demand for testers for high-performance semiconductors is expected to continue to expand. For the interim period ending September, net sales were 526.733 billion yen (up 60.0% year-on-year), operating income was 232.435 billion yen (2.5 times year-on-year), and net income was 169.813 billion yen (2.4 times year-on-year). At the same time, the company announced a share repurchase program with an upper limit of 18 million shares (2.47% of outstanding shares excluding treasury stock) or 150 billion yen, which was also viewed as positive news. The acquisition period is from November 4 to October 28 next year, with the aim of shareholder returns and improving capital efficiency. Furthermore, the company raised the numerical targets of its medium-term management plan, with the fiscal year ending March 2027 as the final year, increasing net sales from 560 billion-700 billion yen to 835 billion-930 billion yen, and operating profit margin from 22-28% to 33-36%. The reason cited is the continued strong demand for testing solutions for HPC (High-Performance Computing)/AI semiconductors, which has increased the likelihood of exceeding the targets set at the time of formulation. ■TOENEC <1946> 1,771 yen +300 yen (+20.4%) Limit high Today's closing price TSE Prime 2nd highest gainer TOENEC <1946> hit its daily limit high.

At the same time, the annual dividend forecast was increased from 52 yen per year (22 yen interim, 30 yen year-end) to 65 yen per year (28 yen interim, 37 yen year-end). Buying flowed in, evaluating the upward revision of the earnings forecast and the company's stance on shareholder returns. For the interim period ending September, although the volume of power distribution line construction and some completed construction projects of subsidiaries fell below expectations, profitability improvements, mainly in indoor wiring construction, exceeded expectations. Increased dividends received from subsidiaries, equity method investment income, and gains on sale of investment securities also contributed to earnings, with net sales of 124.714 billion yen (down 1.7% year-on-year), operating income of 8.566 billion yen (up 32.5% year-on-year), and net income of 7.216 billion yen (2.5 times year-on-year). The full-year net sales forecast was left unchanged. This was based on the recovery in the volume of power distribution line construction, as well as the abundant backlog of indoor wiring construction projects and their favorable progress. Order backlog as of the interim period ending September totaled 125.526 billion yen (up 18.3% year-on-year). The annual dividend of 65 yen represents an effective increase of 15 yen based on the 1-for-5 stock split implemented on October 1, 2024. The company also announced a change in its dividend policy, revising the consolidated dividend payout ratio target from ""30% or more"" to ""approximately 40%."" ■Kinden <1944> 6,158 yen +1,000 yen (+19.4%) Limit high Today's closing price TSE Prime 3rd highest gainer Kinden <1944> was bought up to 6,158 yen, hitting its daily limit high and updating its all-time high. After the close of trading on the 28th, the company revised upward its full-year earnings forecast in conjunction with the announcement of its consolidated financial results for the second quarter (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026. The net sales forecast was raised from the previous forecast of 730 billion yen to 742 billion yen (up 5.2% year-on-year), and the operating income forecast was raised from 67 billion yen to 81 billion yen (up 32.8% year-on-year). At the same time, the annual dividend forecast was increased from 100 yen per year (50 yen interim, 50 yen year-end) to 120 yen per year (60 yen interim, 60 yen year-end) (previous year was 90 yen). Buying gathered, favoring the strong performance and the company's stance on shareholder returns. For the interim period ending September, the company achieved better-than-expected results, driven by improved profitability due to a favorable market environment and successful initiatives to enhance productivity. Net sales were 321.378 billion yen (up 7.8% year-on-year), and operating income was 31.887 billion yen (2.5 times year-on-year). Completed construction work increased in various categories, including power distribution work, information and communication work, and environmental-related work. The full-year earnings forecast incorporates a favorable market environment for the second half of the year, as well as the status of projects on hand. As of the interim period, individual order backlog totaled 460.889 billion yen (up 21.6% year-on-year). Order backlog exceeded the previous year's same period for all types of work, including general electrical work, which saw an increase in office building projects. ■Shikoku Chemicals Holdings <4099> 2,773 yen +366 yen (+15.2%) Today's closing price TSE Prime 4th highest gainer Shikoku Chemicals Holdings <4099> surged in the afternoon session, updating its all-time high. Around noon on the 29th, the company revised its full-year earnings forecast in conjunction with the announcement of its consolidated financial results for the third quarter (January-September) of the fiscal year ending December 2025. The operating income forecast was raised from the previous forecast of 9.4 billion yen to 10 billion yen (up 2.7% year-on-year), and the net income forecast was raised from 6.5 billion yen to 7 billion yen (down 20.6% year-on-year). The operating income, which was initially forecast to decline, is now expected to update its record high for the second consecutive year, which was positively evaluated. The net sales forecast was left unchanged. Although organic chemical products in the chemicals business and the building materials business are expected to fall below previous assumptions, fine chemicals are anticipated to exceed plans. Fine chemicals have high profitability, and increased sales of these products led to an upward revision of each profit. On the other hand, due to foreign exchange losses and the reversal of gains on the sale of investment securities recorded in the previous fiscal year, net income is still expected to decline. For the January-September period, net sales were 52.473 billion yen (down 1.0% year-on-year), operating income was 8.275 billion yen (up 9.5% year-on-year), and net income was 6.022 billion yen (down 11.0% year-on-year). ■Nippon Sharyo <7102> 3,480 yen +445 yen (+14.7%) Today's closing price TSE Prime 5th highest gainer Nippon Sharyo <7102> saw a large influx of buy orders. The previous day, the stock fell for the first time in seven days, drawing a large bearish candlestick due to the overall negative market sentiment, but today it completely changed course and rebounded sharply. After the close of trading on the 28th, the company announced a revision to its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, increasing operating income from the previous plan of 6.6 billion yen to 8.2 billion yen (up 18% year-on-year). This is the second upward revision during the fiscal year; the initial operating income forecast at the beginning of the fiscal year was 5.6 billion yen. Sales in the railway rolling stock, transportation equipment, and steel structure businesses grew more than the company's expectations, contributing to the increase in earnings. Investment funds flowed in, viewing this as a positive factor and anticipating further upside. ■Kandenko <1942> 4,885 yen +452 yen (+10.2%) Today's closing price TSE Prime 6th highest gainer Kandenko <1942> and Craftia <1959> (formerly Kyudenko) surged, updating their all-time highs.

Around 3 PM, the company revised upward its consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, increasing net income from 5.8 billion yen to 7.8 billion yen (compared to a loss of 22.328 billion yen in the previous fiscal year). In addition, the dividend forecast was raised from 14 yen per year (7 yen interim, 7 yen year-end) to 24 yen per year (12 yen interim, 12 yen year-end), which was well received. In its non-consolidated results, an increase in funding profits, such as interest on loans and interest on deposits, is expected to exceed plans. ■Ai Robotics <247A> 1,928 yen +135 yen (+7.5%) Today's closing price Ai Robotics <247A> rose sharply for the fourth consecutive day, updating its effective all-time high. On this day, the company announced that its skincare brand ""Yunth"" had signed a brand ambassador contract with V of K-POP group ""BTS,"" which was viewed as positive news. This initiative marks V's first advertising appearance in Japan after his military discharge and is the first exclusive contract for a skincare brand in Japan. By welcoming V of ""BTS,"" often called a 21st-century pop icon, as a brand ambassador, the company aims to significantly enhance its presence and fully launch its global strategy with an eye on overseas market expansion. ■Takasago Thermal Engineering <1969> 4,588 yen +312 yen (+7.3%) Today's closing price Takasago Thermal Engineering <1969> rebounded sharply, updating its effective all-time high.

In addition, the year-end dividend forecast was raised from 44 yen to 62 yen, which was well received. As a result of reviewing the progress of some construction projects, non-consolidated net sales are expected to fall below the previous forecast. However, due to improved profitability through efficient construction systems and progress in projects, consolidated net sales and profits are expected to be pushed upward. ■NIPPON GAS <8174> 2,821 yen +139 yen (+5.2%) Today's closing price NIPPON GAS <8174> rebounded sharply. After the close of trading on the 28th, the company announced its consolidated financial results for the second quarter (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026. Net sales were 88.195 billion yen (up 2.5% year-on-year), and net income was 3.439 billion yen (2.1 times year-on-year). In addition to the significant increase in profits, the company also announced a share repurchase program, which seems to have been well received. Sales volume increased in the electricity business due to a rise in customers. Trends in fuel prices also contributed to expanding profit margins. The share repurchase program will be conducted between October 29 and March 31 next year, with an upper limit of 4 million shares (3.7% of outstanding shares excluding treasury stock) or 9 billion yen.",Stock Search News,2025-10-29,Positive,Diverged,-2.3155183691113583,8.59469215775072,Diverged,T+1,Strong,22120.0,22.075055187637968,3438.0,-0.3189330240649464,22.393988211702915,8.47130242825607,12.541338081913,-0.6358381502890174,4.971176893696229,2.552151984131015,4.158029846920197,22270.0,0.6781193490054249,3458.0,0.5817335660267597,0.09638578297866518,1.2206148282097649,-0.5359535506922734,0.40650406504065045,-0.2115186927578436,2.418903889523927,3.055855757233486

At levels around 50,000 yen, a rise or fall of 1,000 yen or more is no longer a cause for alarm. The reason it's still hard to feel that way might be because the Nikkei reached the 50,000 yen level too quickly. For those who have long wandered around Kabutocho (Tokyo's financial district), hearing 'Nikkei Average' still brings to mind figures like '2' or '3' (referring to 20,000 or 30,000 yen). In any case, something incredible has been happening in the past few years. The repeated instances of short sellers being squeezed might be because the high of 38,915 yen recorded at the end of 1989, perceived as the peak of the bubble economy, is etched like an imprint in the core of our memories. Nevertheless, the Nikkei Average itself is transforming at an incredible speed. Today, it showed a rise of over 1,000 yen, but looking at individual stocks, nearly 1,400, or 86% of issues, declined. This could be described as a broad market decline based on actual sentiment. Certain stocks are locally becoming 'GAFAM-ized,' such as SoftBank Group <9984> and Advantest <6857>. Today, Advantest rose by 4,000 yen to 22,120 yen, hitting its daily limit high, and a single stock pushed the Nikkei Average up by 1,077 yen. Even if a 1,000-yen rise in the Nikkei Average is now commonplace, today almost the entire gain was driven by Advantest. The Nikkei Average can no longer adequately describe the overall market situation. Meanwhile, the TOPIX closed in negative territory, down 7 points. While 'slightly lower' might seem appropriate, looking at individual stocks, it feels like a downpour, and the sense of incongruity cannot be dispelled. Stock picking also becomes more constrained during earnings season, and frankly, we are now entering a difficult period. There's nothing better than successfully picking up stocks with strong earnings. However, the task of identifying strong earnings stocks whose prices have not yet factored in the news before their announcement, and then anticipating a sharp rise in performance after the announcement, is actually more difficult and riskier than one might imagine. Therefore, waiting for earnings announcements to pass and the noise to subside before seriously narrowing down investment targets is also a powerful investment strategy, as the saying goes, 'waiting is also a market strategy.' In extreme terms, since there are countless stocks with strong performance, a 'cool' approach is to search for optimal solutions from the somewhat disordered market conditions after earnings announcements, rather than making fixed bets. Another investment stance is a 'super long-term' perspective, where one disregards short-term stock price fluctuations related to earnings announcements, and instead, as a shareholder, earns income gains while observing the company's growth (and thus stock price growth). In any case, there is no 'royal road' to stock investing. This is because the very concept of stock investing varies greatly depending on an individual's values and perspective. Recently, following the Japan-U.S. summit meeting, funds are being directed towards stocks that align with the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance. For the time being, fields such as AI, semiconductors, mineral resources (rare earths), quantum, and space will always exist as inlets for investment money, but the tide flow is not uniform, and unevenness always arises. Currently, U.S. Nvidia <NVDA>, U.S. OpenAI, and domestically, Advantest, among others, are leading companies, and the areas around AI and semiconductors are booming. Advantest's remarkable earnings results instilled strong confidence across the entire AI semiconductor-related sector. AI-related themes are drawing investment money's attention to areas like data centers and electricity, which are the foundations of its growth. Today, electrical construction company TOENEC <1946> hit its daily limit high and remained bid-only after upward revisions to its earnings and dividend. Furthermore, stocks like Kinden <1944> and Kandenko <1942> also saw their prices soar across the board. It seems that the intersection of the two themes, data centers and electricity, is becoming a hot spot in the current stock market. Here, ETS Group <253A> is worth noting. It primarily handles electrical equipment and power transmission line construction, providing end-to-end electrical work from foundation construction to steel tower erection and overhead line installation. Needless to say, with a flurry of large-scale data center-related projects currently underway, a mood for re-evaluation is likely to emerge soon. The embers of the major market rally, formed by a series of almost consecutive 'weekly bullish candlesticks' over two months from June to early August this year, are believed to be still alive. Additionally, Seiki Electric Co., Ltd. <6653>, which demonstrates superiority in control systems and other areas with solutions utilizing IoT technology, and JESCO Holdings <1434>, an independent telecommunications construction company strong in ASEAN regions like Vietnam, are also noteworthy. Furthermore, the gradual upward trend of Taihei Dengyo <1968>, a plant construction company primarily focused on power plants and a leader in nuclear power-related fields, is also attractive. On tomorrow's schedule, weekly external and internal securities trading contracts will be disclosed before the start of morning trading. Around noon, the results of the Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Meeting will be announced, followed by a press conference by BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda after the market closes. During the afternoon trading session, September construction machinery shipments will be announced. Also, the Japan Mobility Show will open at Tokyo Big Sight on this day (until November 9). Overseas, September eurozone unemployment rates and preliminary Q3 (July-September) eurozone real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures will be disclosed, and attention will also be focused on the results of the ECB Governing Council meeting. In the U.S., a speech by Fed Vice Chair Bowman is scheduled. Individually, investor interest is high in the earnings announcements of Apple <AAPL> and Amazon.com <AM>.

(6857) has surged, updating its effective all-time high. After the close of trading on the 28th, the company announced an upward revision to its consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026. Sales are revised from 835 billion yen to 950 billion yen (up 21.8% year-on-year), operating profit from 300 billion yen to 374 billion yen (up 63.9% year-on-year), and net profit from 221.5 billion yen to 275 billion yen (up 70.6% year-on-year). Additionally, the interim dividend forecast, which was previously undecided, was set at 29 yen (compared to 19 yen in the same period last year). These announcements have been well-received. Against the backdrop of further complexity, performance improvement, and increased production volume of AI-related semiconductors, demand for high-performance semiconductor testers is expected to continue to expand. For the interim period ending September, sales were 526.733 billion yen (up 60.0% year-on-year), operating profit was 232.435 billion yen (2.5 times year-on-year), and net profit was 169.813 billion yen (2.4 times year-on-year). Concurrently, the company announced a share buyback program with an upper limit of 18 million shares (2.47% of outstanding shares excluding treasury stock) or 150 billion yen, which is also viewed as positive news. The acquisition period is from November 4 to October 28 next year, with the aim of shareholder returns and improving capital efficiency. Furthermore, the numerical targets of the medium-term management plan, with the fiscal year ending March 2027 as the final year, have been raised: sales from 560 billion-700 billion yen to 835 billion-930 billion yen, and operating profit margin from 22-28% to 33-36%. The company attributes this to the continued strong demand for testing solutions for HPC (High-Performance Computing)/AI semiconductors, which has increased the likelihood of exceeding the targets set at the time of formulation.

Operating profit was 43.7 billion yen, a 13.0% increase year-on-year, and the July-September quarter also saw an 11.0% increase, maintaining a double-digit growth trend. Both system support and system integration are steadily expanding sales. The full-year forecast remains unchanged at 86.2 billion yen, a 10.0% increase from the previous fiscal year. While the company's performance stability is strong within the sector, and recent reports had already indicated strong results, the surprise factor was limited. A short-term ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" sentiment seems to be prevailing. Shimano <7309>: 16,325 yen (-1,225 yen), significant rebound. The company announced its third-quarter financial results the previous day. Operating profit for the July-September quarter was 8.4 billion yen, a 57.1% decrease year-on-year. While this is in line with the company's plan, it fell short of market expectations by approximately 1.5 billion yen. Both the bicycle components and fishing tackle segments reported a decrease in profit. The full-year forecast of 46.0 billion yen, a 29.3% decrease in profit from the previous fiscal year, remains unchanged, and a continued decline in revenue and profit is expected for the fourth quarter. Although anticipated, the confirmation of a challenging financial situation led to a negative market reaction. Kinden <1944>: 6,158 yen (+1,000 yen), limit high. The company announced its first-half financial results the previous day, with operating profit significantly increasing 2.5 times year-on-year to 31.9 billion yen. The full-year forecast was revised upward from the previous 67.0 billion yen to 81.0 billion yen, a 32.8% increase from the previous fiscal year. The full-year consensus was estimated to be around 75.0 billion yen. First-half order intake also significantly exceeded market expectations. The annual dividend was also raised from the previously planned 100 yen to 120 yen. Following successive upward revisions by companies like Kinden and Toenec, related buying is extending to other power equipment manufacturers such as Kandenko. Toenec <1946>: 1,771 yen (+300 yen), limit high. The company announced its first-half financial results the previous day, with operating profit reaching 8.57 billion yen, a 32.5% increase year-on-year, exceeding the previous forecast of 7.8 billion yen. Consequently, the full-year forecast was revised upward from the previous 18.0 billion yen to 20.0 billion yen, a 24.7% increase from the previous fiscal year. In addition to the increase in distribution line construction volume, the progress of indoor wiring construction also appears to be strong.

This significantly surpassed the consensus of approximately 330.0 billion yen. This revision is attributed to an updated outlook for the tester market. Other positive factors include an upward revision of medium-term management plan targets and the announcement of a share buyback program with an upper limit of 150.0 billion yen. Microwave Chemical <9227>: 761 yen (-12 yen), continued decline. The company announced that it, along with Takeei (Minato-ku, Tokyo), a consolidated subsidiary of TRE Holdings <9247>, jointly applied for and were selected for a public offering project by the Ministry of the Environment.

The closing price was 51,307 yen, up 1,088 yen. Following gains in US stocks, it started with an increase of over 200 yen and continued to expand its gains throughout the trading session. Although there were quite a few declining stocks in the Prime market, Advantest <6857>, which announced many positive factors such as upward revisions, saw a spectacular rise, and funds flowed into large-cap growth stocks, particularly those related to AI. During the morning session, it surpassed the 51,000 yen milestone, expanding its gains to four digits. In the afternoon session, the pace of ascent slowed, but the strong underlying trend remained unbroken as Advantest was bought up to its daily limit high. Entering the 2 PM hour, buying activity ran its course after the index rose nearly 1,200 yen to reach the 51,400 yen level, but it closed with a four-digit gain. Advantest closed at its daily limit high, single-handedly pushing up the Nikkei 225 by approximately 1,077 yen. The TOPIX continued to trade sideways near its previous day's closing price, resulting in a slight decline. Emerging growth stocks were shunned, with the Growth 250 Index falling by over 2%. The estimated trading value on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime market was 7.09 trillion yen. By sector, non-ferrous metals, electrical machinery, and construction rose, while pulp and paper, real estate, and air transportation declined. Nippon Sharyo <7102>, which announced an upward revision, surged. Conversely, INES <9742>, which announced a downward revision, plummeted. On the TSE Prime market, the number of advancing stocks was 200, and declining stocks was 1,394. Stimulated by Advantest's surge, semiconductor stocks scheduled to announce earnings soon, such as DISCO, Lasertec, and Tokyo Electron, saw significant gains. Ibiden, which was decided for supplementary inclusion in the Nikkei 225, attracted buying for consecutive days. Kinden and Toenec, which handle electrical equipment construction, hit their daily limit highs on the back of their earnings results. Anticipatory buying also flowed into peers such as Kandenko, Chudenko, and Craftia (company name changed from Kyudenko in October). On the other hand, Nidec, designated as a special warning stock by the TSE, saw significant declines for consecutive days. Komatsu's upward revision was not well-received, and its decline widened in the afternoon session. Hokuetsu Corporation, which announced a downward revision, plummeted, and peers such as Nippon Paper Industries and Daio Paper also fell across the board. Weakness in real estate and housing-related stocks, including Mitsui Fudosan, Sumitomo Realty & Development, and Sumitomo Forestry, was prominent. The Nikkei 225 saw a four-digit increase. While Advantest was indeed a major contributor, without it, with declining stocks in the Prime market exceeding 1,000 for consecutive days, there was a possibility of falling below 50,000 yen. The impression is significantly different between falling below 50,000 yen and surpassing 51,000 yen. While caution is needed regarding a potential reaction, it is presumed that many investors are waiting for a dip, as 50,000 yen appears to be a passing point rather than a peak. Tomorrow, the market will digest the FOMC results in the early part of the day, and the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting results at noon. With a US-China summit also scheduled, it could be a busy day swayed by various news. A 0.25% interest rate cut by the FOMC and a policy hold by the Bank of Japan are widely expected. Broadly speaking, if US stocks react positively today to the FOMC outcome, the view that there will be no significant change in the current upward trend will strengthen. However, it should be noted that if the dollar-yen exchange rate shifts significantly towards a stronger yen (weaker dollar) due to reasons such as a sharp drop in US long-term interest rates or increased awareness of an early BOJ rate hike, Japanese stocks may become difficult to trade.",Traders Web,2025-10-29,Positive,Diverged,-2.3155183691113583,8.59469215775072,Diverged,T+1,Strong,22120.0,22.075055187637968,3438.0,-0.3189330240649464,22.393988211702915,8.47130242825607,12.541338081913,-0.6358381502890174,4.971176893696229,2.552151984131015,4.158029846920197,22270.0,0.6781193490054249,3458.0,0.5817335660267597,0.09638578297866518,1.2206148282097649,-0.5359535506922734,0.40650406504065045,-0.2115186927578436,2.418903889523927,3.055855757233486

The U.S. market on the 28th saw the NY Dow rise by 161 dollars and the Nasdaq by 190 points. In addition to the easing of caution regarding U.S.-China trade friction, the movement of earnings being evaluated brightened sentiment. Also, with Nvidia seeing a significant rise, among others, some semiconductor stocks were bought, leading the market. The Chicago Nikkei 225 futures settlement price was 50,695 yen, up 235 yen from Osaka, and the yen exchange rate is trading in the 152.10 yen range against the dollar. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average is likely to start with buying leading the way, converging with Chicago futures. With U.S. semiconductor stocks being bought, the Nikkei 225 futures were seen temporarily rising to 50,810 yen in the night session, and while views cautioning against short-term overheating are likely to increase, buying interest aiming for dips appears strong. Also, Advantest <6857>, which announced its earnings after the close of trading on the previous day, revised its full-year plan upward. The outlook is to exceed consensus, and it is expected to update its all-time high since listing. Advantest, which has a large index impact, is expected to lead the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, and short-covering by sellers is also likely to strengthen. If the company updates its high, it will not only lead to earnings expectations for Tokyo Electron <8035>, which has earnings scheduled for the weekend, but also is expected to provide a catalyst for relatively lagging semiconductor stocks. Ahead of the results of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy meeting, there is a possibility that a sense of stagnation may strengthen after an initial round of buying, but with strong buying interest in high-priced tech stocks with a large index impact, the strength of the Nikkei 225 Stock Average is likely to stand out. Also, at yesterday's Japan-U.S. summit meeting, a favorable Japan-U.S. relationship was likely demonstrated.

Komatsu <6301> Theoretical Stock Price: 5798 Current Stock Price: 5550 Upside Potential: 4.4% Stock Price Level: Appropriate Update Date: 2025/10/29. Details of Theoretical Stock Price. Asset Value: 2611 Business Value: 3187 Market Risk: 0. Theoretical Stock Price = (Asset Value + Business Value) - Market Risk (%). Market Risk is calculated as 0% except for PBR less than 0.5x. Upside Limit Data. Upper Limit Stock Price: 8985 Upside Limit: 61.8%. Upside Limit refers to the upside potential up to an overvalued level. Downside Potential Data. Asset Value: 2611 Downside Potential: -53%. Downside Stock Price refers to the downside potential down to the asset value equivalent. Earnings Evaluation Data. Earnings Evaluation: Average Profit Type Business Value Ratio: 55%. Earnings Evaluation = Business Value ÷ Theoretical Stock Price. The higher the business value ratio, the higher the earnings evaluation. The higher the earnings evaluation, the easier it is for the stock price to rise. About Theoretical Stock Price Web. Theoretical Stock Price Web calculates the theoretical stock price for all stocks using ""Hasshan's Theoretical Stock Price"" method. Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. On the other hand, the theoretical stock price indicates the raw corporate value, with the expectation factor removed. While a stock price being lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. What is more important is whether the theoretical stock price will rise in future earnings reports.

Its consolidated pre-tax profit for the cumulative second quarter (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 decreased by 7.3% year-on-year to 258.3 billion yen. However, at the same time, its full-year pre-tax profit was revised upward by 5.0% from the previous forecast of 442.0 billion yen to 464.0 billion yen (604.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year), and the expected rate of profit decline is projected to narrow from a 26.9% decrease to a 23.3% decrease.

For the most recent three-month period, the July-September quarter (Q2), the consolidated pre-tax profit was 127.0 billion yen, a 0.8% decrease year-on-year, and the sales operating profit margin declined from 14.5% in the same period last year to 13.9%.

After the close of trading on the 28th, the consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 was revised downwards, with sales from 43 billion yen to 39 billion yen (down 3.9% year-on-year), operating profit from 4 billion yen to 1.4 billion yen (down 60.4% year-on-year), and net profit from 2.8 billion yen to 1 billion yen (down 59.0% year-on-year). The dividend forecast was also lowered from 60 yen per year (interim/year-end undecided) to 55 yen per year (25 yen interim, 30 yen year-end), which was met with disfavor. The reason for the decrease in sales is a review of the transition method for standardizing local government information systems. Additionally, the deterioration of the cost ratio for this project is also expected to have an impact. The interim financial results for September, announced simultaneously, showed sales of 16.486 billion yen (down 11.5% year-on-year), an operating loss of 920 million yen (compared to a profit of 876 million yen in the same period last year), and a net loss of 601 million yen (compared to a profit of 537 million yen in the same period last year). Hokuetsu Corporation continued its sharp decline. After the close of trading on the 28th, it announced a downward revision to its consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, with sales from 303 billion yen to 292 billion yen (down 4.5% year-on-year) and operating profit from 18 billion yen to 8 billion yen (down 59.4% year-on-year). The reasons are a decrease in pulp sales volume and a decline in sales prices in overseas markets, as well as a decrease in sales volume of paper and paperboard. The depreciation of the yen is also expected to have an impact. Selling pressure, disliking these factors, is dominant. Digital Holdings fell sharply. After the close of trading on the 28th, it announced the introduction of an emergency-type acquisition defense policy regarding the tender offer (TOB) it is receiving from investment firm Silvercape Investments. The company stated that the conditions set for Silvercape's TOB are opaque regarding whether it will lead to a squeeze-out, and there is a risk that general shareholders may be left behind as minority shareholders. It is highly likely that ""de facto pressure (coercion)"" to tender shares in the TOB will arise, and this policy was introduced to avoid this. Regarding the ongoing TOB from Hakuhodo DY Holdings, the company maintains its supportive opinion and neutral opinion on tendering shares. Fudo Tetra fell sharply. Around 2:45 PM on this day, it announced that new matters requiring investigation and confirmation arose during the course of the investigation by the ""Special Committee on Preventing Recurrence of Fictitious Orders, etc.,"" which was expected to conclude its activities by late October. It received a report from the investigation committee that it would be impossible to complete the investigation within October. Consequently, one new committee member will be added to the current three members. The investigation is currently scheduled to conclude (report received) in late November. Selling pressure, disliking the uncertainty about the future, is emerging. PCA continued its sharp decline. After the close of trading on the 28th, it announced a downward revision to its consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, with sales from 17.689 billion yen to 17.539 billion yen (up 8.0% year-on-year) and operating profit from 2.824 billion yen to 2.543 billion yen (down 3.6% year-on-year). This is because the company failed to achieve its first-half targets for new contract acquisitions, such as PCA Cloud. This became a selling factor. Komatsu's decline widened in the afternoon session. Around 2:30 PM, it announced an upward revision to its consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, with sales from 3.745 trillion yen to 3.888 trillion yen (down 5.3% year-on-year), operating profit from 478 billion yen to 500 billion yen (down 23.9% year-on-year), and net profit from 309 billion yen to 320 billion yen (down 27.2% year-on-year). However, it seems to have been sold off due to a sense of ""all good news priced in."" The revision incorporated the yen's depreciation exceeding expectations, the impact of US tariffs, and the latest market outlook. It also incorporated a revision of the assumed exchange rates for the second half: 140.0 yen to the dollar (previous full-year average forecast 135.0 yen), 163.0 yen to the euro (previous 150.0 yen), and 91.0 yen to the Australian dollar (previous 84.0 yen). The consolidated interim financial results for September, announced simultaneously, showed a decrease in both revenue and profit: sales of 1.8915 trillion yen (down 3.9% year-on-year), operating profit of 277.061 billion yen (down 8.7% year-on-year), and net profit of 175.701 billion yen (down 12.9% year-on-year). In the core construction machinery and vehicles segment, despite efforts to improve sales prices, the impact of the yen's appreciation compared to the same period last year and a decrease in sales volume in Asia had an effect. Mitsui Fudosan, Mitsubishi Estate, and Sumitomo Realty & Development traded weakly. While the Nikkei 225 index rose by over 1,000 yen from the previous day, the real estate sector index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell by over 2%. On this day, US Treasury Secretary Yellen, through a post on social media, expressed her view that the Japanese government's willingness to give the Bank of Japan room for monetary policy would be key to stabilizing inflation expectations and avoiding excessive exchange rate volatility. Regarding the Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Meeting, the consensus for October is to maintain the current policy. In the stock market, the possibility of an interest rate hike after the next meeting is being considered, and selling pressure on real estate stocks increased due to the association that rising interest rates would have a negative impact on the business environment. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced on the 29th that trading of shares in Sumitomo Corporation and SCSK would be suspended from 2:09 PM on the same day. The reason is ""to confirm the veracity of reports regarding a tender offer."" The Nikkei Shimbun Digital Edition reported on the 29th that ""Sumitomo Corporation has decided to make SCSK, a system development company in which it holds a 50.6% stake, a wholly owned subsidiary."" It aims to acquire all shares through a TOB or other means. Tokyo Gas temporarily rose 7% to 5,756 yen. Around 1:30 PM on this day, it announced an upward revision to its consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, with sales from 2.754 trillion yen to 2.839 trillion yen (up 7.7% year-on-year) and operating profit from 159 billion yen to 166 billion yen (up 24.7% year-on-year). The dividend forecast was also increased from 80 yen to 100 yen (80 yen in the previous fiscal year). Additionally, it announced a review of its shareholder return policy based on the conventional total return ratio, revealing a policy to flexibly allocate cash flow to growth investments and shareholder returns within its medium-term cash flow plan. Based on this, its simultaneously announced medium-term management plan (FY2026-2028) outlined shareholder returns of 200 billion yen or more and a dividend increase to 140 yen by FY2028. Furthermore, it announced a share buyback of up to 20 million shares (5.4% of outstanding shares) or 80 billion yen. The period is from November 10 to March 31 next year. Although these announcements were well-received and attracted buying, profit-taking sales subsequently pushed the stock down.

Progress is steady towards the unchanged full-year forecast of 41.5 billion yen, a 38.5% increase year-on-year. Although sales decreased due to factors such as a decline in overseas market conditions for PVC-related products, profitability seems to be improving due to progress in manufacturing cost reduction. By segment, the advanced electronic materials division performed well. < 9742 > INES 1671 -289 Significant continued decline.

The full-year operating profit forecast was revised downward from the previous 4 billion yen to 1.4 billion yen, a 60.4% decrease year-on-year. The annual dividend was also reduced from the planned 60 yen to 55 yen. Lower-than-expected sales due to a review of the migration method for standardization of local government information systems and a worsening cost of sales ratio seem to be the background. < 3865 > Hokuetsu Corp. 836 -127 Significant continued decline. The company announced a downward revision to its earnings forecast yesterday.

A decrease in pulp sales volume and decline in selling prices in overseas markets, a decrease in sales volume of paper and paperboard, and the progression of the weaker yen are behind the downward revision. Since the first quarter results showed an increase in operating profit, the significant downward revision has a negative impact. < 1969 > Takasago Thermal Engineering 4588 +312 Strong rebound. The company announced an upward revision to its earnings forecast yesterday. Operating profit was raised from the previous forecast of 36 billion yen to 43.3 billion yen, a 33.6% increase year-on-year.

Both system support and system integration are steadily expanding sales. The full-year forecast remains unchanged at 86.2 billion yen, a 10.0% increase year-on-year. Earnings stability is strong even within the sector, and since recent reports had already indicated strong performance, the surprise was limited. A short-term sense of having exhausted all positive news seems to be prevailing. < 7309 > Shimano 16250 -1300 Significant decline. The company announced its third-quarter financial results yesterday, with operating profit for the July-September quarter at 8.4 billion yen, a 57.1% decrease year-on-year. Although it is seen as in line with the company's plan, market expectations were undershot by about 1.5 billion yen. Both bicycle components and fishing tackle saw a decrease in segment profit. The full-year forecast of 46 billion yen, a 29.3% decrease year-on-year, remains unchanged, and a continuation of declining revenue and profit is expected for Q4. Although it was anticipated, negative reactions are prevailing as the severe financial results were confirmed. < 1944 > Kinden 6158 +1000 Limit up. The company announced its first-half financial results yesterday, with operating profit at 31.9 billion yen, a significant increase of 2.5 times year-on-year. The full-year forecast was revised upward from the previous 67 billion yen to 81 billion yen, a 32.8% increase year-on-year. The full-year consensus was estimated to be around 75 billion yen. The first-half order backlog also reached a level significantly exceeding market expectations. The annual dividend was also raised from the previous plan of 100 yen to 120 yen. Following successive upward revisions by the company and TOENEC, etc., associative buying is also directed towards other power equipment-related companies such as Kandenko. < 1946 > TOENEC 1771 +300 Limit up. The company announced its first-half financial results yesterday, with operating profit at 8.57 billion yen, a 32.5% increase year-on-year, exceeding the previous forecast of 7.8 billion yen. Consequently, the full-year forecast was revised upward from the previous 18 billion yen to 20 billion yen, a 24.7% increase year-on-year. In addition to an increase in the volume of power distribution line construction, progress in indoor wiring construction also seems to be strong. Also, the company announced a change in dividend policy, raising the dividend payout ratio from the previous 30% or more to a target of 40%, and increasing the annual dividend from 52 yen to 65 yen. < 6857 > Advantest 22120 +4000 Limit up. The company announced its second-quarter financial results yesterday, with operating profit for the July-September quarter at 108.5 billion yen, a 70.7% increase year-on-year, and is believed to have slightly exceeded market expectations. Meanwhile, the full-year forecast was revised upward from the previous 300 billion yen to 374 billion yen, a 63.9% increase year-on-year, significantly exceeding the consensus of around 330 billion yen. This is due to an update in the tester market outlook.

Due to strong performance, the company revised its full-year net profit forecast upward by 24.2% from the previous forecast of 221.5 billion yen to 275.0 billion yen. The growth rate expanded from a 37.4% increase to a 70.6% increase, further raising the previous forecast for a record high profit for two consecutive periods. Additionally, the company announced a share buyback program, acquiring up to 18 million shares or 150 billion yen, representing 2.5% of outstanding shares. ●Surprise Earnings Announcements/Performance Revisions Kinden <1944> [TSE Prime] ★Revised current fiscal year's ordinary profit upward by 24%, raising record high profit forecast, also increased dividend by 20 yen ◆Consolidated ordinary profit for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 surged 2.4 times year-on-year to 34.0 billion yen, exceeding the previous forecast of 24.0 billion yen. This upward revision was driven by improved project profitability due to a favorable market environment, in addition to enhanced productivity. Concurrently, the company revised its full-year ordinary profit forecast upward by 23.6% from the previous forecast of 70.0 billion yen to 86.5 billion yen. The growth rate expanded from an 8.4% increase to a 34.0% increase, further raising the previous forecast for a record high profit for two consecutive periods. Due to strong performance, the annual dividend was revised upward from the planned 100 yen to 120 yen (90 yen in the previous fiscal year).

The growth rate expanded from a 10.7% increase to a 30.2% increase, further raising the previous forecast for a record high profit for two consecutive periods.

Concurrently, the annual dividend was revised upward from the planned 52 yen to 65 yen. The company also changed its dividend policy, raising the dividend payout ratio to 40% or more (previously 30% or more). WOWOW <4839> [TSE Prime] ★Revised first half ordinary profit upward to a 31% increase ◆Consolidated ordinary profit for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 was revised upward 3.5 times from the previous forecast of 600 million yen to 2.1 billion yen. This turned the previous forecast of a profit decrease into an expected 30.8% profit increase. Factors contributing to this upward revision include higher-than-expected other income and the deferral of some expenses, such as program costs, to the third quarter and beyond. Realgate <5532> [TSE Growth] ★Current fiscal year's ordinary profit expected to increase by 35%, marking 8 consecutive periods of record high profits ◆Non-consolidated ordinary profit for the fiscal year ending September 2025 increased by 31.5% year-on-year to 820 million yen. For the subsequent fiscal year ending September 2026, it is expected to expand by 35.1% year-on-year to 1.11 billion yen, marking a record high profit for the eighth consecutive period. For the current fiscal year, the company plans to maintain high occupancy rates for existing managed properties, continuing to accumulate stable stock-type revenue, and in terms of flow-type revenue, plans to sell two owned properties. Concurrently, the company announced a medium-term management plan aiming for an operating profit of 2.5 billion yen by the fiscal year ending September 2028 (actual operating profit for the fiscal year ending September 2025 was 1.04 billion yen).

The rate of profit decrease is expected to narrow from 79.2% to 54.0%. Factors contributing to this upward revision include the resolution of the impact of rising material costs in the tester segment, lower-than-expected research and development expenses, and a weaker yen exchange rate than anticipated. On the other hand, sales were revised downward due to sluggish inquiries and order conditions for testers. Additionally, the company announced that it will cancel 200,000 shares, representing 3.46% of outstanding shares, on November 13. Japan Cash Machine <6418> [TSE Prime] ★Revised first half ordinary profit upward by 2 times ◆Consolidated ordinary profit for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 was revised upward 2.0 times from the previous forecast of 500 million yen to 1.0 billion yen.

Nippon Sharyo <7102> [TSE Prime] ★Revised current fiscal year's ordinary profit upward to an 18% increase ◆Consolidated ordinary profit for the fiscal year ending March 2026 was revised upward by 22.9% from the previous forecast of 7.0 billion yen to 8.6 billion yen. This turned the previous forecast of a profit decrease into an expected 17.9% profit increase. This reflects stronger-than-expected sales in each business segment, as well as improved profit margins due to changes in product mix, among other factors. Musashi <7521> [TSE Standard] ★Revised first half ordinary profit upward by 58%, also increased full-year forecast and dividend by 10 yen ◆Consolidated ordinary profit for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 was revised upward by 57.8% from the previous forecast of 1.5 billion yen to 2.37 billion yen. This was due to strong sales of election system equipment, a proprietary product, for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election and the House of Councillors election. Following the strong first-half performance, the full-year ordinary profit forecast was also revised upward by 42.6% from the previous forecast of 1.92 billion yen to 2.74 billion yen. The rate of profit decrease is expected to narrow from 59.4% to 42.1%.

Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. On the other hand, the theoretical stock price indicates the intrinsic corporate value, with the element of expectations removed. While a stock price being lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. More importantly, whether the theoretical stock price will rise in future financial results. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (indicating expectations), the stock price is also likely to rise in conjunction. Conversely, for stocks where expectations have run too far ahead, causing the stock price to significantly exceed the theoretical stock price, there is a risk of a sharp decline if financial results do not demonstrate performance commensurate with the stock price (in cases where expectations shrink). If the theoretical stock price fluctuates significantly at the time of financial results, it may present an opportunity for a level correction.",Fisco,2025-10-28,Neutral,Diverged,25.391295775143924,4.669681519422137,Diverged,T+1,Strong,18120.0,-0.4122011541632316,3449.0,-1.0329985652797704,0.6207974111165389,-0.9068425391591096,0.49916805324459235,-0.805291918320391,-0.33780220297095126,0.7189209395576625,-0.7547006947739024,22120.0,22.075055187637968,3438.0,-0.3189330240649464,22.393988211702915,8.47130242825607,12.541338081913,-0.6358381502890174,4.971176893696229,2.552151984131015,4.158029846920197

For the second quarter cumulative period, net sales were 1,284,522 million yen (up 1.4% year-on-year), and ordinary income was 367,339 million yen (down 17.1% year-on-year). In the Lifestyle and Environmental Infrastructure Materials business, net sales were 500.4 billion yen (down 2% year-on-year), and operating income was 102.3 billion yen (down 33% year-on-year). Regarding polyvinyl chloride (PVC), demand in North America was firm from the beginning of the year to mid-year, but then weakened, and market conditions softened. The continued sluggishness in prices in other overseas markets, including Asia, also had an impact. The consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2024 remains unchanged, with net sales of 2,400 billion yen (down 6.3% from the previous fiscal year) and ordinary income of 700 billion yen (down 14.7% from the previous fiscal year). The progress rate of the second quarter cumulative results against the full-year earnings forecast is 53.5% for net sales and 57.8% for ordinary income. The company's assumed exchange rates from October onwards are approximately 145 yen to the US dollar and approximately 165 yen to the euro. The closing price on the 27th was 4,725 yen, down 180 yen from the previous weekend.",Wealth Advisor,2025-10-27,Negative,Aligned,-1.91995995069097,-0.3345762211470487,Aligned,T+1,Strong,4725.0,-3.669724770642202,3485.0,2.2894041678896393,-5.959128938531841,-1.4271151885830784,-2.2750775594622543,0.40334197637568425,0.0,2.005875994994271,3.6261529504082786,4672.0,-1.1216931216931216,3449.0,-1.0329985652797704,-0.08869455641335122,0.19047619047619047,-1.309674693705112,-0.805291918320391,-0.6311373207881786,1.107681636426073,0.3218409287480218

Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities changed its view, stating that the stock price has reached a reasonable level. The investment rating was upgraded from ""Underweight"" to ""Equal-weight"", and the target price was raised from 3,000 yen to 3,100 yen. Morgan Stanley revised its operating profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2027 from 27.8 billion yen to 30.7 billion yen (YoY +10%). Previously, it was believed that the stock price was overvalued, with expectations for IP ownership preceding the risks associated with investments in large-scale projects with significant risks. However, with no prominent movie or TV anime releases scheduled for the current fiscal year and a lack of positive catalysts, the stock price has fallen by approximately 13% over the past three months and about 17% year-to-date. This led to the change in view that the stock price has reached a reasonable level. While revenue diversification through secondary use of IP is progressing, it is believed that the situation where risks associated with global expansion, etc., are recognized will continue.★10:48 Lasertec - MSMUFG raises target price, business environment improves in the short term Lasertec <6920> continued to rise. SMBC Nikko Securities judged that the business environment would improve in the short term. The investment rating was maintained at ""Underweight"", and the target price was raised from 10,400 yen to 11,300 yen. MSMUFG revised its earnings forecast and target price upward, incorporating the latest changes in the market environment. It believes that mass purchases of EUV lithography equipment by memory manufacturers, foundry investments in the United States, and a shift from US-made equipment to Japanese-made equipment in China will be tailwinds for short-term earnings recovery. On the other hand, it pointed out that the competitive environment remains severe, and thus the investment rating was kept unchanged.★10:50 Miroku - Surges as bear attacks on humans occur frequently in various regions, buying into the company, which is the domestic leader in hunting rifles Miroku <7983> surged. The catalyst is the successive human injuries caused by bears in various regions. According to the Akita Sakigake Shimpo electronic edition dated the 27th, the number of victims in Akita Prefecture for the current fiscal year, announced by 9 PM on the 26th, reached 54, approaching the 70 victims in fiscal year 2023 when bears frequently appeared in urban areas. In October alone, 35 people were affected, significantly exceeding the cumulative total for typical years and marking the worst single-month situation ever. In response, it appears that buying driven by earnings expectations is flowing into the shares of the company, which is the domestic leader in hunting rifles.★10:52 Komatsu - MSMUFG raises target price, high-level profits to continue Komatsu <6301> saw a significant continued rise. Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities judged that high-level profits would continue. The investment rating ""Overweight"" was maintained, and the target price was raised from 5,100 yen to 5,400 yen. MSMUFG made minor revisions to its earnings forecast. For full-year operating profit, MSMUFG's forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 was slightly raised from the old 550 billion yen to the new 555 billion yen, and for the fiscal year ending March 2027, from the old 600 billion yen to the new 625 billion yen. MSMUFG believes that securing high-level profits is possible through the expansion of sales of high-margin mining machinery and spare parts, along with an aggressive pricing strategy.★11:07 SBI Holdings - MSMUFG raises target price, revision of medium-term vision is a future focal point SBI Holdings <8473> saw a significant continued rise. Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities commented that the revision of the medium-term vision is a future focal point. The investment rating ""Equalweight"" was maintained, and the target price was raised from 4,730 yen to 6,440 yen. Morgan Stanley anticipates continued strong performance in the financial services business in Q2. The PE investment business, which was negative in the previous fiscal year, recorded valuation gains from multiple listed stocks (such as Circle and eToro) in Q1 of the current fiscal year. It is expected to record a gain on sale of Sumishin SBI Net Bank (approximately 140 billion yen) in Q3, and negative goodwill from Kyobo Life (approximately 30 billion yen) within fiscal year 2025. It pointed out that the annualized ROE at the end of Q1 was 24%, significantly exceeding the medium-term vision (15%), making the revision of the medium-term vision a future focal point. The earnings forecast was revised to reflect the progress up to Q1 and market conditions from July to September.★11:08 Cross Marketing - Continues to rise, launches stage-gate solution ""Growth Way"" Cross Marketing Group <3675> continued to rise. The company announced at 11 AM on the 27th that its consolidated subsidiary, Cross Marketing, would begin offering the stage-gate solution ""Growth Way"" from October 2025. ""Growth Way"" is described as a solution that integrates the extensive knowledge and expertise cultivated by Cross Marketing. It aims to support not only at times when research is needed but also in the construction and promotion of product development and the entire marketing process.★11:10 Chugai Pharmaceutical - Nomura lowers target price, full-year FY25.12 company plan upside remains unchanged Chugai Pharmaceutical <4519> fell for the third consecutive day. Nomura Securities expects that the full-year FY25.12 company plan upside remains unchanged. The investment rating ""Neutral"" was maintained, and the target price was lowered from 6,500 yen to 6,400 yen. Nomura revised its earnings forecast based on the FY25.12 July-September financial results.

For full-year operating profit, MSMUFG's forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 was slightly raised from the old 550 billion yen to the new 555 billion yen, and for the fiscal year ending March 2027, from the old 600 billion yen to the new 625 billion yen.

Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. In contrast, the theoretical stock price indicates the intrinsic corporate value with the expectation factor removed. While a stock price lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. More importantly, it is whether the theoretical stock price will increase in future financial results. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (indicating expectations), the stock price tends to rise in conjunction. Conversely, for stocks where expectations have run too far ahead, causing the stock price to significantly exceed its theoretical stock price, there is a risk of a sharp decline if financial results do not demonstrate performance commensurate with the stock price (in cases where expectations shrink). If the theoretical stock price changes significantly at the time of financial results, it may present an opportunity for a level correction.",Fisco,2025-10-24,Positive,Diverged,-2.6703633242122624,1.1203610920131308,Diverged,T+1,Strong,6935.0,-3.061224489795918,0.0,0.0,-3.061224489795918,-1.7332960581492873,-1.3513513513513513,,-1.2709859843606692,0.9083417651538068,-0.2774362684052971,6787.0,-2.1341023792357605,3485.0,2.2894041678896393,-4.4235065471254,-0.8940158615717375,-1.251273097628401,0.40334197637568425,-0.8494302510224347,1.2602956330975088,0.7816948277238795

The market views this as leading to economic recovery, and it has garnered investor expectations, particularly as a continuation and strengthening of Abenomics. Aggressive investment in defense-related industries and advanced technologies (such as nuclear fusion and space business) is anticipated, leading to ""Takaichi trades"" where related stocks are being bought. Furthermore, expectations for continued monetary easing tend to drive a weaker yen, which in turn boosts expectations for improved performance among export-related companies. However, let's calmly assess the current stock price and earnings levels. The operating profit forecast for the current fiscal year 2025 is around ±0 year-on-year, and the estimated PER for the Nikkei 225, currently around 49,200 yen, is 18.9x. The sluggish earnings growth is likely influenced by the year-on-year appreciation of the yen, the slowdown in the Chinese economy, and U.S. tariffs. On the other hand, the PER is in a high range. Given the understanding that the average PER for the index is typically in the 13-15x range, a PER of approximately 19x implies that an earnings increase of over 30% year-on-year for the next fiscal year 2026 is already priced in. Assuming that the upper limit of the index's PER has risen to 18x due to an exit from deflation and a change in how companies approach the stock market, and if we set the earnings growth rate for the next fiscal year 2026 at around 10%, the upper limit for the Nikkei 225 would be approximately 51,600 yen. The current Nikkei 225, around 49,200 yen, would reach this upside target with an increase of about 5%. Under similar assumptions, if the PER is 15x, the Nikkei 225 would be around 43,000 yen, and if it's 13x, it would be around 37,300 yen. Nevertheless, for companies whose earnings continue to rise and whose dividends increase accordingly, you wouldn't want to let go of them, even if the overall market hits a short-term ceiling and the undervaluation of their stock diminishes. The simplest approach would be to believe in the future of Japanese stocks as a whole and the companies you hold, and simply continue to hold them without doing anything. However, for those who find it unbearable to idly watch a decline when a clear short-term upside has been reached, hedging through margin trading or individual stock options (Kabu-Opu) would be the course of action. Individual stock options are gaining popularity, with the estimated principal for transactions in September 2025 reaching approximately 68.5 billion yen, marking an all-time high since the integration of the derivatives markets by the Osaka Exchange and Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2014. Is this perhaps due to individual stock options limiting losses, in contrast to the theoretically unlimited losses of short selling, and generally offering higher capital efficiency than margin trading? Let's consider how to think about Toyota, a popular stock for individual stock options, in relation to the overall market. While there is a tendency for profit decline recently due to rising raw material costs (inflation) and a stronger yen, the operating profit CAGR over the past 10 fiscal years, including the current year's forecast, is +5.4%. During the same period, the stock price rose from 1,100-1,450 yen to a 2024 high of 3,891 yen, currently trading slightly above 3,000 yen, representing an annual appreciation of just under 10% if we consider a rise from 1,300 yen to 3,000 yen (dividends are also added to this). ROE also exceeds 10%, dividends continue to increase, and the yield for the current fiscal year is 3.06%. That's excellent. Recognizing that the competitive environment due to the rise of EVs and changes in the global economic system differ from the past decade, imagine Toyota's stock three years from now with earnings growing at 10% annually and a PER of 15x. The stock price would be slightly over 4,000 yen. This is about 30% above the current stock price of 3,100 yen. In this scenario, as a buy-and-hold strategy, no clumsy maneuvers might be necessary. On the other hand, if you feel that projecting three years out is too much given the rapidly changing environment, and you only have confidence up to a PER of 15x based on current year's forecast, or around 3,400 yen with a PER of 15x based on 10% earnings growth for the next fiscal year (as next year is starting to be considered), then you would likely take profits when the Nikkei 225 approaches 51,600 yen and Toyota stock nears 3,400 yen. Of course, if you lack confidence but believe Toyota is a good company, and you're willing to hold at the current 3,100 yen and take profits if it rises to around 3,400 yen, you could sell a call option with a strike price of 3,400 yen for individual stock options, thereby earning option premium income while creating a 'sell reservation' (covered call).",Fisco,2025-10-24,Positive,Diverged,-0.2762643881567324,2.7347823335022117,Diverged,T+1,Weak,3127.0,1.1646716273050794,0.0,0.0,1.1646716273050794,0.6146878032999029,0.5466237942122186,,0.4530722074336899,0.746461057517535,-0.6802446488639559,3218.0,2.910137511992325,3485.0,2.2894041678896393,0.6207333441026859,1.3751199232491205,1.5141955835962144,0.40334197637568425,1.4436913570510126,0.9771726532123314,-0.06099458519638191

About Theoretical Stock Price Web Theoretical Stock Price Web calculates the theoretical stock price for all stocks using the ""Hasshan-style Theoretical Stock Price"" model. Stock prices fluctuate significantly, reflecting expectations for future performance. On the other hand, the theoretical stock price indicates the intrinsic corporate value, with the element of expectation removed. While a stock price being lower than its theoretical stock price is proof of undervaluation, it does not necessarily mean the stock price will rise solely for that reason. What is more important is whether the theoretical stock price will increase in future financial results. If the theoretical stock price continues to rise (indicating positive expectations), the stock price tends to rise in conjunction. Conversely, for stocks where expectations have run too far ahead, and the stock price significantly exceeds the theoretical stock price, there is a risk of a sharp decline if the company fails to demonstrate performance commensurate with the stock price in its financial results (if expectations shrink). If the theoretical stock price changes significantly at the time of financial results, it may present an opportunity for a level correction.

みんかぶ","Toyota surges, updates year-to-date high; U.S. GM's significant rise after earnings announcement stimulates auto stocks ◇Toyota Motor <7203> surged with a gap up, updating its year-to-date high. Auto stocks such as Honda <7267> and SUBARU <7270> are all rising. U.S. auto giant General Motors <GM> announced on the 21st its financial results for the July-September 2025 period (third quarter), which, while showing a decrease in profit, had adjusted earnings per share exceeding market expectations. In conjunction, it revised its full-year outlook upward, and GM shares finished trading up nearly 15% in the U.S. stock market on the same day. The positive reaction of GM shares after the earnings announcement appears to have become a stimulus for auto stocks. GM proceeded with the earnings forecast revision this time, assuming that the impact of tariffs would be smaller than expected, among other factors. Nissan Motor <7201> and Mazda <7261> are also up.(Note) The ""◇"" at the end of the title indicates an article containing multiple stock issues in the main text.Source: MINKABU PRESSMinna no Kabushiki (minkabu PRESS)MinkabuLast updated: 10/22 (Wed) 9:32Minkabu",Minkabu,2025-10-22,Positive,Aligned,1.7758276036036926,0.1273014655767359,Aligned,T+1,Strong,3104.0,3.2945091514143092,3421.0,0.3814553990610329,2.9130537523532762,2.329450915141431,0.9430894308943091,0.5584950029394474,1.834865578556417,2.0944959577537516,3.530168968034506,3091.0,-0.41881443298969073,3407.0,-0.40923706518561825,-0.009577367804072479,-0.12886597938144329,-0.2903225806451613,0.2058823529411765,-0.41183726854590136,0.7113674276051658,-0.7894824273911152

Following this announcement, the stock opened lower in the morning but turned positive, as the market viewed the news as already priced in. Although sales remained at the previously forecast 28 billion yen (down 11.3% year-on-year), profits fell below plan due to the impact of additional costs for some projects and increased personnel expenses. KDDI <9433> 2,444.5 yen +2.5 yen (+0.1%) Today's closing price. KDDI <9433> is firm.

The company's stock price had accelerated its ascent this month, rising by over 40% in three weeks to a high of 25,735 yen reached the previous day, but is now experiencing a reaction. In terms of Nikkei 225 constituent weighting, SoftBank Group surpasses Advantest <6857> to hold the top position among the 225 stocks. Today, the Nikkei Average saw volatile movements, temporarily falling by over 700 yen, with SoftBank Group alone accounting for over 80% of that decline. A mid-tier securities strategist commented, ""It's not a reaction to negative news specific to the company's stock, but rather mechanical selling by AI algorithms exacerbating the decline.""

This is believed to be the largest single-day decline in history. After a significant rise since the beginning of the year and hitting a new high the previous day, profit-taking and position adjustment selling expanded. Expectations for progress in US-China trade talks and a stronger dollar are also seen as headwinds for gold prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a new high on the 21st is also believed to have caused funds to shift from safe-haven gold to risk assets like stocks. Advantest <6857> 17,100 yen -300 yen (-1.7%) Today's closing price. Advantest <6857> saw selling pressure. In the US stock market the previous day, major semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Micron Technology performed weakly, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index) also fell back. The SOX Index continues to trade near its all-time high, but its upside momentum has recently become somewhat heavy. Furthermore, the outlook for the October-December quarter announced by semiconductor giant Texas Instruments after the close of the US stock market the previous day fell below market consensus, causing a sharp drop in after-hours trading, which is also viewed negatively. On the other hand, the recent shift towards a stronger dollar and weaker yen in the foreign exchange market is seen as a factor supporting stock prices.

From October 2024 to February 2025, it traded around 2,000 yen. In March, it approached the milestone of 3,000 yen, but on April 7, it sharply declined due to heightened caution regarding U.S. tariff measures. After that, it rose steadily while repeatedly fluctuating, reaching a high of 4,124 yen on August 13, but with this as a ceiling, it traded in the high 3,000 yen range until around the end of September. Late on September 30, the company announced a downward revision to its consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (final profit down 11.5% from the previous forecast), but this was due to the privatization of its consolidated subsidiary Mitsubishi Logisnext, a major forklift manufacturer, so selling was limited. The sharp rise occurred on October 6 (+11.17% from the previous day), as the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new president in the Liberal Democratic Party presidential election held on the 4th was seen as a positive factor. Buying in anticipation of the realization of policies by Ms. Takaichi, who has long advocated for strengthening defense, led the way, and the stock temporarily reached a high of 4,251 yen. Subsequently, there were periods of fluctuation due to uncertainty in the political outlook following Komeito's withdrawal from the coalition government, but as the possibility of President Takaichi being elected Prime Minister increased, the company's stock also rose, continuing to gain for four consecutive business days from October 15 to 20. On the afternoon of the 21st, the House of Councillors held a prime ministerial nomination election in its plenary session and elected LDP President Takaichi as the 104th Prime Minister.

The decline in US tech stocks, among other factors, is being disliked. In the US market yesterday, AI-related stocks such as Alphabet and Nvidia declined. While the NY Dow rose, the Nasdaq and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index) fell. Furthermore, US semiconductor giant Texas Instruments, which announced its earnings after the market close, plunged in after-hours trading. The company's stock price has risen significantly recently as a leading AI-related stock, reaching an all-time high of 25,735 yen yesterday. The increase from the end of last year is 2.8 times. It was also a stock that saw particularly active trading in the 'Takaichi Trade,' and yesterday, after hitting a new high, it turned negative. Today, selling to close positions, seeing a pause in the rally, further intensified, leading to a decline of over 9% currently. Advantest <6857>, Lasertec <6920>, and Fujikura <5803>, which had been leading the market rally as AI-related stocks, are also down.★9:22 Itami Art - Plunges; Prime Minister Takaichi expresses negative view on early dissolution of the House of Representatives.Itami Art <168A> plunged. The reason is that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi held her first press conference after assuming office at the Prime Minister's Official Residence on the 21st and expressed a negative view on an early dissolution of the House of Representatives. According to an article in the Nikkei Digital Edition dated the 21st, she expressed a negative view on an early dissolution of the House of Representatives, stating that economic measures are the top priority, and commented, 'There is no time to talk about dissolution right now.' The company handles banners, sashes, armbands, and magnetic sheets for election vehicles, and before the prime ministerial designation election, buying had entered due to speculation about an early dissolution of the House of Representatives. However, due to Ms. Takaichi's remarks, that expectation faded, leading to significant selling.★9:33 Toyota - New High; Favored by US GM's upward revision and yen depreciation; Buying in auto stocks.Toyota Motor <7203> reached a new high. The surge in US General Motors (GM) stock price and the ongoing yen depreciation are being favored. GM announced its July-September earnings on the 21st. Although net profit decreased year-on-year, it raised its full-year outlook, partly due to reduced tariff impacts. This was well-received, and GM shares closed with a nearly 15% gain. Furthermore, the yen depreciated, triggered by the inauguration of Sanae Takaichi, who is said to favor aggressive fiscal policy and monetary easing, as the new Prime Minister. There were moments overnight when the yen reached the 152 yen level against the dollar. Following the earnings outlook of major US automakers and the ongoing yen depreciation, domestic auto stocks are also seeing buying. Honda <7267>, SUBARU <7270>, Mazda <7261>, Denso <6902>, and others are also up.★9:38 Inter-Trade - Surges; Stablecoins 'may partially replace bank deposits,' says BOJ Deputy Governor = Nikkei.Inter-Trade <3747> surged. The Nikkei Shimbun morning edition dated the 22nd reported that Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino stated on the 21st that '(stablecoins linked to the value of fiat currency) could partially replace the role of bank deposits and emerge as a major player in the international payment system.' He reportedly spoke at an event hosted by US research firm Eurasia Group. Following the report, buying entered the company, which handles trading systems for gold-backed stablecoin 'Zipangcoin,' Speee <4499>, which conducts stablecoin-related businesses through its subsidiary, and Asteria <3853>, which invests in JPYC (Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo), an issuer of yen-denominated stablecoins.★9:49 Daido Steel - Sharp Rebound; Developed magnets without heavy rare earths; Investment plan to triple production due to increased orders reported.Daido Steel <5471> sharply rebounded. The reason is that Toyo Keizai Online featured the company on the 21st as a company that developed magnets without using heavy rare earths, which are 100% dependent on China, in the manufacturing of magnets that are inseparable from rare earths. According to the article, the company invited Dr. Masato Sagawa, who is nominated for the Nobel Prize every year as the developer of neodymium magnets, as an advisor, and has been refining the development of 'completely heavy rare earth-free' magnets among neodymium magnets. The headline of the same article also mentioned 'investment plan to triple production due to increased orders,' suggesting that buying has entered in response to the favorable news.★9:51 Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku - Indicated at Limit Up; Developed ceramics material without rare earths.Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo <4082> was indicated at limit up. The company announced on the 21st that it has newly developed a calcia-stabilized zirconia material, 'DURAZR-S series, product name: HSY-0774,' as a ceramic material. Zirconia generally uses rare earths such as yttria as a stabilizer. In contrast, the newly developed product successfully uses readily available calcia (calcium oxide) as a stabilizer. Since it does not use rare earths, it is expected to contribute to a more stable supply of ceramic products.

を凌ぎトップに位置している。きょうは日経平均が一時７００円あまりの下落をみせるなど波乱含みの値動きとなったが、その下げ分の８割強をソフトバンクＧが１銘柄で占める状況となっており、「（同社株固有の）悪材料に反応しているということではないが、ＡＩアルゴリズムの機械的な売りが下げを助長している」（中堅証券ストラテジスト）という指摘が聞かれる。株式需給面では直近１７日現在で信用買い残が増勢となる一方、売り残は減少しているが、信用倍率は１．３倍台と引き続きタイト感がある。また、日証金の貸借倍率は２１日現在で１．０２倍と売り買い拮抗した状態にある。 ■ＳＰＤＲ < 1326 > 57,370円 -2,990 円 (-5.0％) 11:30現在 金ＥＴＦが急落。ＳＰＤＲゴールド・シェア < 1326 > が一時、前日に比べ７％超安に売られたほか、ＮＥＸＴ FUNDS 金価格連動型上場投信 < 1328 > や純金上場信託（現物国内保管型） < 1540 > が大幅安となっている。２１日のニューヨーク商品取引所（ＣＯＭＥＸ）の金先物相場は、１２月限が前日比２５０．３ドル（５．７％）安の１トロイオンス＝４１０９．１ドルと急落した。一日の下落幅としては過去最大とみられている。年初から大幅な上昇を演じ、前日には最高値を更新していたが、利益確定やポジション調整の売りが膨らんだ。米中通商協議の進展期待やドル高が金価格には逆風になったとの見方も出ている。２１日にＮＹダウが最高値を更新したことも、資金がリスク資産の株式に向かい、安全資産の金から離散したとみられている。 ■アドバンテスト < 6857 > 16,815円 -585 円 (-3.4％) 11:30現在 東証プライム 下落率6位 アドバンテスト < 6857 > 、東京エレクトロン < 8035 > など半導体製造装置関連は売り優勢。前日の米国株市場ではエヌビディアやアドバンスト・マイクロ・デバイシズ、マイクロン・テクノロジーなど半導体の主力銘柄が軟調に推移しフィラデルフィア半導体株指数（ＳＯＸ指数）も反落した。ＳＯＸ指数は最高値圏での推移が続いているが、足もとで上値がやや重くなっている状況だ。また、前日の米株市場取引終了後に発表された半導体大手テキサス・インスツルメンツの１０～１２月期見通しが市場コンセンサスを下回る内容で、時間外で急落していることもネガティブ視される。一方、外国為替市場で足もとドル高・円安方向に振れていることは株価の下支え材料として意識される。アドテストや東エレクは日経平均構成比で上位に位置しており、日経平均株価への影響力も大きいだけに、その値動きが注目される。 ■西松屋チェーン < 7545 > 2,108円 -6 円 (-0.3％) 11:30現在 西松屋チェーン < 7545 > は小高い場面があったもののその後冴えない動き。２１日の取引終了後に発表した１０月度（９月２１日～１０月２０日）の月次売上高速報で、既存店売上高は前年同月比４．４％減と、２カ月ぶりに前年実績を下回ったことが嫌気されているようだ。気温の高い日が続いたことで、秋物衣料や冬物衣料の売上高が前年を下回った。なお、全店売上高は同０．２％増だった。 ■第一稀元素化学工業 < 4082 > 794円 +100 円 (+14.4％) ストップ高 11:30現在 東証プライム 上昇率トップ 第一稀元素化学工業 < 4082 > はストップ高水準となる前営業日比１００円高の７９４円に買われ、年初来高値を更新した。２１日、セラミックス製品の材料となるジルコニア粉末シリーズ「ＤＵＲＡＺＲ－Ｓシリーズ」の「ＨＳＹ－０７７４」を新規開発したと発表した。中国によるレアアースの輸出規制が話題になるなか、新規開発品はレアアースを使わないという特徴を持っており、事業の成長を期待する買いが流入している。稀元素によると、セラミックス製品の材料となるジルコニアには一般的に安定化剤としてイットリアなどのレアアースが使われている一方、新規開発品では入手が容易な酸化カルシウムを安定化剤として使うことに成功した。

After the close of trading on the previous day, the company announced that it had concluded a business alliance agreement with South Korean company HM Solution for the joint development of thread lift materials for nose bridge formation and exclusive import agency. The company aims to expand its product portfolio in the thread lift market and establish a second pillar of business following injection-based procedures. ■IHI <7013> 2,998 yen +158 yen (+5.6%) as of 11:30 IHI <7013> sharply rebounded. Kawasaki Heavy Industries <7012> was bought, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011> is performing strongly. The Sanae Takaichi cabinet was inaugurated on the 21st. At a press conference on the evening of the same day, Prime Minister Takaichi expressed her intention to instruct the revision of the 'Three Security Documents,' including the National Security Strategy, to increase defense spending. Taking this as a cue, and amidst a pause in the Nikkei Average's upward momentum, there is a growing trend to seek out defense-related stocks. In the Takaichi cabinet, Shinjiro Koizumi was appointed Minister of Defense. ■eGuarantee <8771> 1,631 yen +63 yen (+4.0%) as of 11:30 eGuarantee <8771> has risen for three consecutive days. After the close of trading on the 21st, it became clear that Ariake Capital (Chuo-ku, Tokyo), which primarily invests in regional banks, had increased its stake in eGuarantee shares, which seems to have attracted speculative buying. According to the amendment report submitted on the same day, Ariake Capital's ownership ratio increased from 7.24% to 8.33%. Under the purpose of holding, it states 'pure investment' as well as 'to provide advice to management and make important proposals depending on the situation.' The date the reporting obligation arose was the 14th. ■Toyota Motor <7203> 3,096 yen +91 yen (+3.0%) as of 11:30 Toyota Motor <7203> surged, opening with a gap, and updated its year-to-date high. Automotive stocks such as Honda <7267> and SUBARU <7270> are all rising. General Motors, a major US automaker, announced its Q3 (July-September) 2025 earnings on the 21st, which, despite a decrease in profit, saw adjusted earnings per share exceed market expectations. In conjunction, the full-year outlook was revised upward, and GM shares closed nearly 15% higher in the US stock market on the same day. The positive reaction of GM shares after the earnings announcement seems to have stimulated automotive stocks. GM decided to revise its earnings forecast this time, assuming that the impact of tariffs would be smaller than expected. Nissan Motor <7201> and Mazda <7261> are also up. ■JGC Holdings <1963> 1,530.5 yen +29.5 yen (+2.0%) as of 11:30 JGC Holdings <1963> has rebounded. After the close of trading on the 21st, the company announced that its subsidiary JGC, together with JR Kyushu <9142> and Enecoat Technologies (Kumiyama-cho, Kyoto Prefecture), had installed film-type perovskite solar cells on the platform of Hakata Station and started a power generation demonstration experiment, which is being viewed positively. In this demonstration experiment, which is the first of its kind in Japan to use perovskite solar cells for power generation on a station platform roof, JGC developed Enecoat's film-type perovskite solar cells into a solar power generation system using a lightweight and easily detachable sheet construction method, and JR Kyushu installed them on the roof at the tip of Hakata Station's second platform to conduct the demonstration. As railway operations consume large amounts of electricity for trains and station buildings, there are expectations for the possibility of improving the utilization rate of renewable energy by implementing perovskite solar cells. ■ERI Holdings <6083> 3,945 yen +70 yen (+1.8%) as of 11:30 ERI Holdings <6083> rebounded. After the close of trading on the 21st, the company announced that it would acquire shares in TOMPLA (Kawasaki City, Saiwai-ku), a venture company developing small drones, and make it a subsidiary. The share transfer date is scheduled for within the month. This seems to be viewed as a positive factor. ■istyle <3660> 479 yen +8 yen (+1.7%) as of 11:30 istyle <3660> has risen for three consecutive days. After the close of trading on the 21st, the company announced that it would open its first overseas flagship store, '@cosme HONG KONG,' on December 5. This will be its fourth flagship store, following Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. This seems to be the catalyst. ■AEON Kyushu <2653> 2,991 yen +46 yen (+1.6%) as of 11:30 AEON Kyushu <2653> has rebounded. After the close of trading on the 21st, the company announced that it would acquire all shares of Tokiwa Industry (Oita City, Oita Prefecture), which operates 23 supermarkets and other stores in Oita Prefecture, with a scheduled acquisition date of January 31, 2026, making it a subsidiary, which is being viewed positively. The aim of this acquisition is to enhance the group's corporate value by acquiring new customers and establishing a strong dominant position in Oita Prefecture. The acquisition price is undisclosed. Furthermore, the impact on the fiscal year ending February 2026 performance is stated to be minor. ■Plus Alpha Consulting <4071> 2,428 yen +29 yen (+1.2%) as of 11:30 Plus Alpha Consulting <4071> has risen for three consecutive days. After the close of trading on the 21st, the company announced that Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank had adopted its talent management system 'Talent Palette'. Additionally, on the morning of the 22nd, it announced the launch of its conversation skill improvement support service 'AI Talk Train'. It states that generative AI creates realistic personas similar to actual customer interactions, enabling practical response training. The successive releases seem to have been viewed as positive factors. ■Teijin <3401> 1,341 yen +15.5 yen (+1.2%) as of 11:30 Teijin <3401> has risen for three consecutive days. Effissimo Capital Management, a Singapore-based investment fund established by former Murakami Fund associates, submitted an amendment report to the Kanto Local Finance Bureau after the close of trading on the 21st. According to the report, the shareholding ratio increased from the previous 11.08% to 12.12%, attracting speculative buying. The date the reporting obligation arose was October 14. The purpose of holding is stated as pure investment. ■SoftBank Group <9984> 23,630 yen -1,290 yen (-5.2%) as of 11:30 TSE Prime 2nd largest decline SoftBank Group <9984> sharply declined, temporarily falling by over 10%, breaking below its 5-day moving average, which had been a support line for the upward trend, with a large bearish candlestick. The company's stock price had accelerated its rise since the beginning of this month, increasing by over 40% in three weeks to reach a high of 25,735 yen set on the previous day, but a reaction to this surge is now being seen. In terms of Nikkei Average weighting, SoftBank Group ranks first among the 225 stocks, surpassing Advantest <6857>. Today, the Nikkei Average saw volatile movements, including a temporary decline of over 700 yen, but SoftBank Group alone accounted for over 80% of that decline, leading to comments such as, 'It's not a reaction to negative news specific to the company's stock, but mechanical selling by AI algorithms is exacerbating the decline' (mid-tier securities strategist). In terms of stock supply and demand, as of the 17th, margin buying has been increasing while short selling has decreased, but the margin ratio remains tight at around 1.3 times. Additionally, the Japan Securities Finance Co. (JSF) loan-to-stock ratio was 1.02 times as of the 21st, indicating a balanced state of buying and selling. ■SPDR <1326> 57,370 yen -2,990 yen (-5.0%) as of 11:30 Gold ETFs sharply declined. SPDR Gold Shares <1326> temporarily fell by over 7% compared to the previous day, while NEXT FUNDS Gold Price Linked ETF <1328> and Pure Gold ETF (Physical Domestic Storage Type) <1540> also saw significant declines. On the 21st, gold futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange (COMEX) for the December contract sharply fell by $250.3 (5.7%) from the previous day to $4,109.1 per troy ounce. This is believed to be the largest single-day decline in history. After a significant rise since the beginning of the year and hitting a new high on the previous day, profit-taking and position adjustment selling expanded. There are also views that expectations for progress in US-China trade talks and a stronger dollar acted as headwinds for gold prices. The fact that the NY Dow updated its record high on the 21st is also seen as capital shifting towards risk assets like stocks and away from safe-haven gold. ■Advantest <6857> 16,815 yen -585 yen (-3.4%) as of 11:30 TSE Prime 6th largest decline Semiconductor manufacturing equipment-related stocks such as Advantest <6857> and Tokyo Electron <8035> are dominated by selling. In the US stock market on the previous day, major semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Micron Technology performed weakly, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index) also fell back. While the SOX Index continues to trade near its all-time high, it is currently facing some resistance to further upside. Furthermore, the outlook for the October-December quarter announced by semiconductor giant Texas Instruments after the close of the US stock market on the previous day fell below market consensus, and its sharp decline in after-hours trading is also viewed negatively. On the other hand, the current trend of a stronger dollar and weaker yen in the foreign exchange market is seen as a supporting factor for stock prices. Advantest and Tokyo Electron are highly weighted in the Nikkei Average, and their movements are closely watched due to their significant influence on the Nikkei Average. ■Nishimatsuya Chain <7545> 2,108 yen -6 yen (-0.3%) as of 11:30 Nishimatsuya Chain <7545> saw a brief rise but then moved sluggishly. The quick report on monthly sales for October (September 21 - October 20) announced after the close of trading on the 21st showed that existing store sales decreased by 4.4% year-on-year, falling below the previous year's results for the first time in two months, which seems to have been disliked. Due to continued warm days, sales of autumn and winter clothing fell below the previous year's levels. Total store sales, however, increased by 0.2%. ■Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo <4082> 794 yen +100 yen (+14.4%) Limit Up as of 11:30 TSE Prime Top Gainer Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo <4082> was bought up to 794 yen, a 100 yen increase from the previous trading day, reaching its limit up level and updating its year-to-date high. On the 21st, the company announced the new development of 'HSY-0774' in its zirconia powder series 'DURAZR-S Series,' which is a material for ceramic products. Amid discussions about China's export restrictions on rare earths, the newly developed product features the absence of rare earths, attracting buying in anticipation of business growth. According to Kigenso, while zirconia, a material for ceramic products, generally uses rare earths such as yttria as a stabilizer, the newly developed product successfully uses easily obtainable calcium oxide as a stabilizer. ●Limit Up Stocks Kaname Kogyo <6566> 1,584 yen +300 yen (+23.4%) Limit Up as of 11:30 JDSC <4418> 1,681 yen +300 yen (+21.7%) Limit Up as of 11:30 RC Core <7837> 710 yen +100 yen (+16.4%) Limit Up as of 11:30 and 4 other stocks ●Limit Down Stocks Sakurajima Futo <9353> 2,875 yen -700 yen (-19.6%) Limit Down as of 11:30 and 1 other stock",Stock Search News,2025-10-22,Positive,Aligned,1.7758276036036926,0.1273014655767359,Aligned,T+1,Strong,3104.0,3.2945091514143092,3421.0,0.3814553990610329,2.9130537523532762,2.329450915141431,0.9430894308943091,0.5584950029394474,1.834865578556417,2.0944959577537516,3.530168968034506,3091.0,-0.41881443298969073,3407.0,-0.40923706518561825,-0.009577367804072479,-0.12886597938144329,-0.2903225806451613,0.2058823529411765,-0.41183726854590136,0.7113674276051658,-0.7894824273911152

JDSC <4418> saw strong buying interest in the afternoon session. The company announced at 12:06 on the 20th a capital and business alliance with SoftBank <9434>, and a third-party allotment of shares with SoftBank as the allottee.
The payment due date for the third-party allotment is November 7. The number of shares issued is 1.6 million. The issue price is 931 yen per share. Approximately 1,483,589,520 yen will be raised as net proceeds, which will be allocated to human resource investment and strengthening the management foundation. The dilution rate against the total number of outstanding shares is 11.56%. SoftBank's shareholding ratio in the company after the capital increase is expected to be 10.24% (3rd largest shareholder).
Through this capital and business alliance, the companies will collaborate as mid-to-long-term strategic partners in the AI domain, aiming to accelerate the social implementation of cutting-edge AI technology in anticipation of the coming AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) era.

The new company believes that by broadly soliciting agreement and participation from manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers across the entire industry involved in manufacturing, distribution, and sales, it will contribute to improving convenience and efficiency for the entire industry through centralized management of product information in accordance with the ""Five Principles of Product Information,"" such as accountability for product information to consumers, as set forth in the ""Product Information Platform Concept.""
Regarding the new company, considering the short period for establishment and service launch, as well as the risk-taking during the unstable initial business period, the three companies will primarily operate it until the business stabilizes (approximately three years). After that, they will re-examine investment, company operations, and other aspects, taking into account the new company's establishment objectives.

Nomura pointed out that steady profit growth is expected to continue under a business portfolio strategy based on proprietary technologies cultivated in photographic film. Strong performance in niche digital cameras and electronic materials for advanced semiconductors is expected to lead to solid short-term results. In bio CDMO, where large-scale investments are being made, attention is focused on the increasing competitive advantage due to U.S. pharmaceutical tariffs.

Through this agreement, both companies will further accelerate business development from a mid-to-long-term perspective, aiming to develop an additional 200 megawatts (with an investment scale of over 20 billion yen) over three years starting from 2026. This will achieve a cumulative development of 300 megawatts and aims to build a stronger partnership.

Digital Grid <350A> surged. The company announced at 12:00 on the 20th that the handling volume of renewable energy-derived power plants has reached 300 megawatts. The renewable energy handling capacity for Q1 of the fiscal year ending July 2026 was more than 10 times that of Q1 of the fiscal year ending July 2024.
The company believes that the main reason for this acceleration is the ""RE Bridge"" renewable energy matching platform, which has accelerated the needs of both power generators who want to sell renewable energy without using the FIT scheme and consumers who want to procure renewable energy to meet their decarbonization targets.
★13:02 Sony G - Nomura raises target price; estimates upside effect from ""Demon Slayer"" movie
Sony Group <6758> rebounded for the first time in three days. Nomura Securities estimated the upside effect from the ""Demon Slayer"" movie. It maintained its ""Neutral"" investment rating and raised its target price from 4,500 yen to 4,700 yen.
Nomura revised its earnings forecast upward, taking into account the spin-off of its financial business, a revision of its exchange rate assumptions towards a weaker yen, and the contribution of recent hit titles such as ""Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Mugen Train Arc Part 1."" While noting the risk of a decline in image sensor market share due to U.S. tariff policies, it expects that the impact can be mitigated by reviewing capital investment plans. For the fiscal year ending March 2027, with major titles such as the third-party software ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" and the movie ""Spider-Man: Brand New Day"" in the pipeline, the entertainment business is expected to continue expanding.
