Lines' downward revision; Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha also trading lower. NYK Line <9101> saw a sharp fall in the afternoon session. This is due to negative sentiment following Mitsui O.S.K. Lines <9104> announcing at 12:00 on the 4th that it has revised its consolidated net profit forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026 downward from the previous 200 billion yen to 180 billion yen (a 57.7% decrease year-on-year). The container shipping business is expected to fall below previous forecasts, and net profit is planned to be below market consensus. Reacting negatively to this, Mitsui O.S.K.

This revision is based on the first-half performance in the beauty care, healthcare, and fine chemical sectors of wool grease derivatives, primarily in the functional products field. Consolidated operating profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 2.98 billion yen (a 24.2% increase year-on-year). In addition, the company announced the cancellation of 1.55 million treasury shares. The scheduled cancellation date is November 20.

They maintained their investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised their target price from 3,300 yen to 9,500 yen. SMBC Nikko forecasts operating profit for the fiscal year ending December 2025 to be $431.2 million, exceeding the company's plan of $410 million. From the second half of the fiscal year ending December 2025, they expect efficient sales acceleration utilizing new bases for EPCI projects (Gato do Mato, Hammerhead) ordered this year. In O&M, as major maintenance on chartered vessels settles down, they have incorporated an improvement in profitability, with the first-half operating profit margin of 8.3% rising to a second-half forecast of 11.6%. They commented that from the second half of the fiscal year ending December 2025 onwards, profitability improvement can also be expected as operations utilizing new bases accelerate for newly ordered EPCI projects this fiscal year.

SMBC Nikko updated its earnings forecasts based on financial results and interviews. They noted the materialization of contributions from large projects in nucleic acid drug CDMO, in addition to strong device demand from key customers. They believe there is a high possibility of a share buyback announcement at the time of the Q3 earnings release. Based on the FCF outlook, they assume a scale of 50 billion yen (previously: 30 billion yen). They forecast operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 2027 to increase by 12% year-on-year, driven by new applications for high-precision substrates, automotive polarizing films, CDMO, and electrically peelable tapes. They expect the company to update its record-high profits. However, judging from consensus profit levels and valuation metrics, they believe expectations in the stock market are also high. ★12:53 Nexela Pharma - Sharply fell for 5 consecutive days; cumulative Q3 net loss expanded; impacted by increased R&D expenses, etc. Nexela Pharma <4565> sharply fell for 5 consecutive days. The company announced on October 31 that its consolidated net loss for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was 4.81 billion yen (compared to a loss of 3.50 billion yen in the same period last year). This was impacted by increased cost of sales and R&D expenses, and deterioration in financial balance. ★13:06 HOYA - Morgan Stanley MUFG raises target price; HDD glass substrates to be the biggest growth driver in 2026-27. HOYA <7741> fell back. Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities commented that HDD glass substrates will be the biggest growth driver in 2026-27. They maintained their investment rating at ""Equal-weight"" and raised their target price from 20,000 yen to 23,000 yen. Morgan Stanley raised its EPS forecast for FY25-27 by approximately 4%, based on the increase in 3.5-inch substrates in July-September and the growth of video-related products. They forecast the growth rate of 3.5-inch glass substrates to be in the low teens annually for FY25-26, accelerating to the high teens in FY27 due to contributions from shipments to two new customers. They expect the profitability of healthcare, which was low in July-September, to improve to approximately 20% from FY26 onwards, which is the company's guideline. On the other hand, while the fundamental outlook is good, they believe the stock price has already factored in expectations for HDD glass substrate growth until around 2027.",Traders Web

Money Forward <3994> continued its sharp decline. The company announced on the 4th that it has revised downward its consolidated operating loss forecast for the full fiscal year ending November 2025 from the previous range of 4.70 billion yen to 2.30 billion yen in losses, to a new range of 4.80 billion yen to 2.40 billion yen in losses (compared to a 4.74 billion yen loss in the previous fiscal year). The market consensus was a 2.86 billion yen loss. Due to the transfer of all shares held in its consolidated subsidiary, SmartCamp, a significant change in the business portfolio occurred, resulting in the entire SaaS Marketing segment being excluded from the scope of consolidation. Consequently, the earnings forecast was revised.
★9:32 OSG - Daiwa Raises Target Price; Intention to Strengthen Shareholder Returns Positive, but Profitability Improvement Still in Progress
OSG <6136> continued its decline. Daiwa Securities judged that while the intention to strengthen shareholder returns is positive, the improvement in profitability is still in progress. It maintained its ""3 (Neutral)"" investment rating and raised its target price from 1,800 yen to 2,200 yen. Daiwa judged that although the recent stock price has continued to rise, driven by awareness of a PBR of 1x due to the statement ""dividend payout ratio has exceeded 40% for three consecutive periods, including the current fiscal year's estimate, and a change in policy for the next fiscal year and beyond is under consideration,"" it is difficult to expect a valuation exceeding a PER of around 10x (with an estimated EPS of 219 yen) when considering the estimated ROE for the fiscal year ending November 2027. The keyword for the current medium-term plan is ""Beyond."" With the effects of past M&A, the balance of products/regions is being achieved, and the plan is to aim for an unprecedented improvement in profitability (operating profit margin exceeding 16%, ROE exceeding 10%). It pointed out that while the first year is a slow start, the development of a scenario that can absorb fluctuations in demand is awaited.

★9:36 Nidec - Sharp Continued Rise; Concludes Commitment Line Agreement Totaling 600 Billion Yen

The company announced on the 4th that it has concluded a commitment line (credit facility) agreement totaling 600 billion yen with its main transaction banks, MUFG Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.

This revision is based on factors such as sales volumes of heater modules for diffusion furnaces used in solar panel manufacturing, which were expected to be ordered from the second half of the fiscal year by its Chinese subsidiary in the insulation material business, falling below plan. The consolidated operating profit/loss for the second quarter (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 was a 340 million yen loss (compared to a 630 million yen profit in the same period of the previous year).
★9:43 Toshin Holdings - Hits New Low; Net Loss in Previous Fiscal Year, Current Fiscal Year Forecast Undisclosed

The company announced on the 4th that its consolidated net profit/loss for the full fiscal year ending April 2025 was an 80 million yen loss (compared to a 140 million yen profit in the previous fiscal year). An investigation by a third-party committee revealed facts of inappropriate accounting treatment within the company. As a result of recording extraordinary losses as expenses for correcting past financial statements, among other factors, the company fell into a net loss. The earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending April 2026 is undisclosed. This is because it is difficult to reasonably calculate an earnings forecast at this time. Furthermore, the company had postponed its financial results announcement due to the time required for the investigation into the inappropriate accounting treatment.",Traders Web

The company's plan for the first half was 15.0 billion yen. Market consensus was 17.7 billion yen. The steel business exceeded previous forecasts due to improved profitability of domestic group companies and inventory valuation differences. The engineering business is said to have exceeded expectations due to increased sales revenue from the steady execution of ordered projects. Concurrently, the company announced a downward revision to its consolidated revenue forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026, from the previous 4.75 trillion yen to 4.60 trillion yen (down 5.3% year-on-year).

Deliveries of large-scale projects are progressing in the automotive, healthcare, and aerospace/infrastructure businesses, and the electronics business is also proceeding relatively smoothly. Although the situation remains uncertain, the company raised its full-year outlook due to stronger-than-initially-expected capital investment by manufacturing industries, which are its main customers. The annual dividend forecast will be 122 yen (92 yen in the previous fiscal year). Consolidated operating profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 6.59 billion yen (up 7.6% year-on-year). ★14:17 Fujifilm HD - Turned Negative in Afternoon Session, First-Half Operating Profit Up 17% but Hit by Profit-Taking Sales.

Concurrently, the consolidated revenue forecast was raised from the previous 3.28 trillion yen to 3.30 trillion yen (up 3.3% year-on-year). This was based on the strong performance of the imaging business. The assumed exchange rates for the full fiscal year were set at 145 yen to the dollar and 162 yen to the euro.

Revenue increased due to growth in the Toy and Hobby business and stable performance in the Amusement business. On the other hand, each profit item remained in decline, affected by factors such as a decrease in profit margin due to reduced sales of repeat titles in the Digital business, and a reactionary decline following the success of multiple theatrical releases in the Visual and Music business during the same period of the previous year. Net sales: 643,816 million yen (up 5.3% year-on-year), Operating profit: 105,481 million yen (down 7.2% year-on-year), Ordinary profit: 110,196 million yen (down 4.6% year-on-year), Net profit: 78,909 million yen (down 2.3% year-on-year). The situation for each main segment is as follows.

① Toy and Hobby Business: Net sales: 317,830 million yen (up 9.0% year-on-year), Segment profit: 65,035 million yen (up 8.9% year-on-year). Despite being partially affected by tariffs, the business performed strongly due to the expansion of product categories and lineups both domestically and internationally, the expansion of customer touchpoints through real events and stores, and the strengthening of production systems and distribution. Specifically, products for high-target (adult) demographics, such as Gunpla (plastic models from the Gundam series), collector's figures, and Ichiban Kuji (character lottery), performed well due to strengthened sales and marketing efforts and an expanded product lineup. Additionally, card products such as trading card games, Gashapon (capsule toys), and confectionery/food products contributed to performance through the expansion of product lineups, target demographics, and operating regions, as well as the strengthening of customer touchpoints. Furthermore, Tamagotchi-related products, including the new product ""Tamagotchi Paradise,"" gained popularity both domestically and internationally.

② Digital Business: Net sales: 231,504 million yen (up 1.3% year-on-year), Segment profit: 37,386 million yen (down 16.4% year-on-year). In network content, the new app title ""SD Gundam G Generation Eternal"" performed strongly, attracting new fan demographics. Additionally, major app titles such as the ""DRAGON BALL"" series, ""ONE PIECE,"" and ""THE IDOLM@STER"" series performed stably due to continuous initiatives targeting users. In home video games, the new title ""ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN"" was a worldwide hit, and ""Tamagotchi no Puchi Puchi Omisechi Omachido~sama!"" gained popularity due to synergistic buzz with the Toy and Hobby business. On the other hand, differences in the composition of home video game titles affected performance, such as a decrease in sales volume of repeat titles compared to the same period of the previous year. The Digital business will continue to aim for title development that prioritizes quality and meets fan expectations, and will work to build a balanced and optimal title portfolio.

③ Visual and Music Business (formerly IP Production Business): Net sales: 41,078 million yen (down 0.5% year-on-year), Segment profit: 5,359 million yen (down 20.2% year-on-year). The new visual work in the Gundam series, ""Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX,"" gained popularity by attracting new fan demographics in addition to existing fans, and contributed to performance through theatrical box office revenue, global video distribution, and licensing of products and services. Additionally, global expansion and video distribution of existing Gundam series and ""Blue Lock,"" among others, performed stably. Overall, the Visual and Music business did not reach the level of the same period of the previous year, when theatrical box office revenue from multiple hit theatrical releases significantly contributed to performance.

④ Amusement Business: Net sales: 75,380 million yen (up 5.2% year-on-year), Segment profit: 7,046 million yen (down 3.4% year-on-year). Existing store sales at domestic amusement facilities were 106.0% compared to the same period of the previous year. Additionally, Bandai Namco's unique facilities, such as ""Bandai Namco Cross Store"" and ""Gashapon Department Store,"" which are linked with the group's products and services, as well as activity facilities, performed strongly. In the sale of arcade games, ""Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. 2 Infinite Boost"" performed strongly. In the Amusement business, the role of fan touchpoints will be further strengthened to expand awareness of the group's products and services.

★9:05 MinebeaMitsumi - Declined; First-half operating profit down 5.1%; Profit decline in Semiconductor & Electronics business
MinebeaMitsumi <6479> declined. The company announced on the 6th that its consolidated operating profit (IFRS) for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 44.4 billion yen (down 5.1% year-on-year). Market consensus was 45.4 billion yen.
This was primarily due to a decrease in sales of optical devices in the Semiconductor & Electronics business, which led to a decline in both revenue and profit.
In addition, the company announced that the previously undecided year-end dividend forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 would be 25 yen (25 yen at the end of the previous fiscal year). The annual dividend forecast is 50 yen (45 yen for the previous fiscal year).
★9:05 Double Scope - Sharp continued decline; Raised 1.06 billion yen through stock acquisition rights; To be allocated to working capital, etc.
Double Scope <6619> continued its sharp decline after a period of no change. The company announced on the 6th the issuance of its 10th and 11th series of stock acquisition rights with exercise price adjustment clauses through a third-party allotment to Macquarie Bank Limited, as well as the conclusion of a stock acquisition rights repurchase agreement (Target Issue Program).
The allotment date for both is November 25. The total number issued is 40,000 units (10th series: 30,000 units, 11th series: 10,000 units). The number of potential shares is 4 million shares. The initial exercise price is 222.3 yen for the 10th series and 400.0 yen for the 11th series. The lower limit exercise price is 149 yen. Approximately 1,055.56 million yen will be raised as net proceeds and allocated to working capital such as personnel expenses and material costs, as well as office expansion funds. The maximum dilution rate against the total number of outstanding shares will be 7.24%.
★9:05 Komatsu - Daiwa raises target price; Next fiscal year's performance to plateau
Komatsu <6301> declined. Daiwa Securities expects next fiscal year's performance to plateau. It maintained its investment rating of ""3 (Neutral)"" and raised its target price from 4,200 yen to 4,600 yen.
At the briefing after the financial results announcement, Daiwa mentioned that due to the significant burden of steel and aluminum tariffs, an estimate was presented that the impact of US tariffs, on a net basis including countermeasures such as price increases, would be approximately 120 billion yen next fiscal year, compared to 55 billion yen this fiscal year. While continuous price pass-through is being considered, the fact that US Caterpillar is not very aggressive in raising prices at present is one of the concerns. Daiwa's forecast assumes this burden to be 55 billion yen this fiscal year and 115 billion yen next fiscal year, with segment profit projected to be 530 billion yen this fiscal year (company plan: 505 billion yen) and 478 billion yen next fiscal year. While a recovery to 545 billion yen is expected in the fiscal year ending March 2028, Daiwa stated that it first wants to confirm the profit level for the next fiscal year.

The company announced on the 6th that its consolidated operating profit (IFRS) for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was 114.9 billion yen (up 13.7% year-on-year). Market consensus was 114.2 billion yen. Progress against the full-year company plan was 69.6%.
Sales recovered in all categories and areas. Revenue and profit increased due to the continuous improvement in earning power, including increased volumes and pricing strategies. In addition to significant improvements in profitability for cosmetics, strong performance in fabric & home care and feminine hygiene products contributed to the profit increase.
The stock price, however, saw selling pressure due to concerns about the slow progress.
★9:07 NTV HD - Continued rise for 5 consecutive days; Revised full-year net profit upward; First half increased by 65%
Nippon Television Holdings <9404> continued its rise for 5 consecutive days. The company announced on the 6th that it had revised its consolidated net profit forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026 upward from the previous 47 billion yen to 50 billion yen (up 8.7% year-on-year).
This was based on the expectation that Nippon Television Network's spot advertising revenue and business revenue would exceed previously announced forecasts, progress in cost control, and the strong performance of consolidated subsidiaries, among other factors.
Consolidated net profit for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 26.4 billion yen (up 65.3% year-on-year).
Furthermore, the share buyback announced on the same day was also well-received.

The company announced on the 10th that it has revised its consolidated net income forecast for the full fiscal year ending March 2026 from a previous profit of 36 billion yen to a loss of 17 billion yen (compared to a profit of 45.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year). Construction work on the metaxylylenediamine production facility of its Dutch subsidiary has been temporarily suspended due to a deterioration in the business environment. As a result of evaluating the recoverable amount of the fixed assets of the subsidiary based on this situation, an impairment loss will be recorded. This is expected to lead to a net loss. Consolidated net income for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was a loss of 27.9 billion yen (compared to a profit of 24.7 billion yen in the same period of the previous year). This was impacted by the decline in market prices for engineering plastics and methanol, an increase in fixed costs associated with strengthening production capacity at its Taiwan base for semiconductor chemicals, and the recording of an impairment loss at its Dutch subsidiary. ★9:00 Kose - Sell-off indication: 3Q cumulative operating profit down 28%, impacted by increased marketing costs and other factors Kose is showing a sell-off indication. The company announced on the 10th that its consolidated operating profit for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was 13.6 billion yen (down 27.8% year-on-year). The market consensus was 16.8 billion yen. While sales decreased in Greater China and Kose Cosmeport, overall sales increased due to significant growth in sales of 'Cosme Decorte' and Albion in Japan. On the other hand, profit decreased due to increased administrative expenses, including goodwill amortization for newly consolidated Purely, and increased marketing and logistics costs for Tarte. ★9:00 Pixel - Sell-off indication: 8.4 billion yen raised through new shares and stock acquisition rights, to be allocated to capital investment Pixel Companies is showing a sell-off indication. The company announced on the 10th the issuance of new shares and the 16th series of stock acquisition rights through a third-party allotment. The new shares will be allotted to abc and Seacastle Singapore (Singapore), and the stock acquisition rights will be allotted to Seacastle Singapore. The payment due date for the new share issuance is December 10. The number of shares issued is 46.75 million shares. The issue price is 40 yen per share. Payment for the new share issuance will be made by way of contribution of monetary claims (debt-equity swap). The allotment date for the stock acquisition rights is December 10. The total number issued is 1,732,500 units (potential shares: 173.25 million shares). The exercise price is 40 yen. Approximately 8,398.33 million yen will be raised as net proceeds and allocated to capital investment funds for the data center business and other purposes. The maximum dilution rate against the total number of outstanding shares will be 224.16%. ★9:00 Mitsubishi Estate - Sell-off indication: First-half net income up 16% but below consensus Mitsubishi Estate is showing a sell-off indication. The company announced on the 10th that its consolidated net income for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) was 58.1 billion yen (up 16.1% year-on-year). The market consensus was 64.8 billion yen. In the residential business, significant profit growth was achieved due to increased profits from domestic condominiums. Capital gains are expected to be recorded mainly in the second half, and progress is as planned. The stock price is predominantly selling due to the results falling below the consensus forecast. ★9:01 Shiseido - Sell-off indication: Full-year net loss of 52 billion yen expected, turning to a loss, impacted by impairment loss on Americas business Shiseido is showing a sell-off indication. The company announced on the 10th that it has revised its consolidated net income forecast (IFRS) for the full fiscal year ending December 2025 from a previous profit of 6 billion yen to a loss of 52 billion yen (compared to a loss of 10.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year). The market consensus was a profit of 8 billion yen. As a result of impairment tests conducted due to the decline in profitability of the Americas business, an impairment loss of 46.8 billion yen on goodwill was recorded, leading to results falling below the previous forecast. Consolidated net income for the cumulative third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (January-September) was a loss of 44 billion yen (compared to a profit of 800 million yen in the same period of the previous year). Sales decreased mainly in the China and Travel Retail businesses, which continued to be affected by declining consumption due to worsening economic sentiment, and the Americas business, where 'Drunk Elephant' continued to struggle. The recording of an impairment loss on goodwill in the third quarter also had an impact. The company also announced the implementation of a voluntary retirement program, 'Next Career Support Plan.' The estimated number of participants is around 200. Expenses such as special severance payments arising from the implementation of this program are estimated to be around 3 billion yen and are planned to be recorded as non-recurring items in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025.

●【1】Today's Stock Market & Featured Stocks at a Glance!
AI-related stocks rapidly lose momentum, reversing from a 600-yen gain to a fall.

[Today's Market] Nikkei Stock Average slightly falls back!
On the U.S. market on the 10th, major stock indices all rose. Investor sentiment improved due to rising expectations that the government shutdown would be lifted within a few days, and a significant rise in tech stocks, particularly semiconductor giant Nvidia, which reportedly received increased production requests from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Although news of the government shutdown lifting had been circulating since the previous day, the Nikkei Stock Average briefly rose to 51,513.16 yen (+601.4 yen) in early trading today. Expectations seemed to have further increased with reports that a provisional budget bill was expected to pass not only the Senate but also the House of Representatives in the U.S. soon. On the other hand, as AI (Artificial Intelligence)-related stocks, which had been bought temporarily, lost momentum, the market saw volatile movements, turning downward in the afternoon. Major general contractors such as Kajima Corporation and Taisei Corporation, which revised their earnings and dividend forecasts upward, surged in the afternoon. Meanwhile, declines were prominent in some semiconductor stocks like Advantest and Fujikura, and wire and cable stocks. KOKUSAI ELECTRIC, which revised its earnings forecast downward during trading hours, plummeted towards the end of trading.

[Today's Featured Stocks]
◆Shiseido (4911) 2,562.5 yen (-23.0 yen)
Operating loss for the cumulative third quarter (January-September) of the fiscal year ending December 2025 was 33.3 billion yen (compared to a 2.1 billion yen profit in the same period of the previous year). An unexpected loss was incurred due to impairment in the Americas business, but sales improved both domestically and internationally, and core operating profit, excluding temporary factors, increased by 9.7% year-on-year to 30 billion yen, exceeding market expectations. The company stated that structural reforms are progressing smoothly and expressed confidence in achieving the targets set in its medium-term management plan. It seems to have been perceived as all bad news being priced in, and the stock price saw moments of significant rise.

◆Sony Group (6758) 4,520 yen (+236 yen)
Announced financial results for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 at noon today. Operating profit increased by 20.4% year-on-year to 768.9 billion yen, exceeding market expectations. Furthermore, the full-year plan was revised upward from 1.33 trillion yen to 1.43 trillion yen (a 12.0% increase year-on-year). In addition to the music business, which benefited from the movie ""Demon Slayer,"" image sensors for mobile devices, where unit prices for new products for major customers increased and shipment volumes exceeded expectations, seem to be performing well.

◆Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012) 10,685 yen (-695 yen)
Pre-tax profit for the first half (April-September) of the fiscal year ending March 2026 increased by 49.0% year-on-year to 35.3 billion yen, a double-digit increase, but fell short of market expectations. The full-year plan for net sales was revised upward from 2.29 trillion yen to 2.34 trillion yen (a 9.9% increase year-on-year), but profits were kept at a level below market expectations, considering the impact of tariffs. Order intake was also revised upward, driven by an increase in aircraft engines for the Ministry of Defense and commercial aircraft, but this seems to have been perceived as unsatisfactory.

●【2】Tuesday Corner ""Investment & Money Questions"" What happens to taxes when you sell gold?
(Question) I want to sell the pure gold I've been accumulating, how will it be taxed?
(Answer) If the annual profit from sale is 500,000 yen or less, it is tax-exempt. If it exceeds 500,000 yen, the taxable amount changes depending on the holding period!

""Gold"" is attracting attention due to soaring prices. Many people, like the questioner, are likely considering selling to realize profits. However, if you are accumulating pure gold, or holding physical gold such as bullion or jewelry, taxation upon sale is somewhat complex. The two main points are: ① whether the sale ""profit"" is 500,000 yen or less, and ② whether the holding period is more than 5 years. Let's check below.

Profits from selling gold held in forms such as pure gold accumulation, bullion, or jewelry are classified as capital gains. First, calculate the profit from sale by subtracting (acquisition cost + selling fees) from the sale price. If you sell multiple times within a year, sum them up to calculate the total annual profit from sale. From that, subtract the special deduction for capital gains of 500,000 yen, and the remaining amount is subject to taxation. In other words, if the profit from sale is 500,000 yen or less, it becomes tax-exempt due to the special deduction, and a tax return is not required. This is point ①. For those who want to save on taxes, one strategy is to divide the selling timing across different years to keep the annual profit from sale within 500,000 yen.

If the profit from sale exceeds 500,000 yen, the amount that could not be fully deducted by the special deduction becomes taxable. What needs to be checked here is point ②: ""Is the holding period more than 5 years?"" If the gold holding period is more than 5 years, it is classified as ""long-term capital gains,"" and the taxable amount is reduced by half. Expressed as a formula, the taxable amount becomes: {Sale Price - (Acquisition Cost + Selling Fees) - Special Deduction of 500,000 yen} ÷ 2. On the other hand, if the holding period is 5 years or less, it is classified as ""short-term capital gains,"" and there is no reduction measure for the taxable amount. If the gold being sold includes both short-term and long-term holdings, calculate the taxable income for short-term and long-term separately, and then sum them up. Note that the special deduction of 500,000 yen is for both short-term and long-term combined. If short-term and long-term are mixed, it is applied preferentially to the calculation of short-term capital gains.

Capital gains from gold are subject to comprehensive taxation, and a tax return is required. The calculated taxable amount is combined with other income, such as employment income, to determine the tax rate. As can be understood from the explanation so far, calculating the taxable amount requires knowing the gold's acquisition date (for determining the holding period) and acquisition cost. When purchasing gold or jewelry at a store, be sure to keep necessary records such as proof of purchase or receipts. In cases where the acquisition cost is unknown, such as when gold is acquired through inheritance, it is common to calculate ""5% of the sale price"" as the deemed acquisition cost. In other cases, if there is a reasonable and objectively explainable reason, such as determining the year of manufacture from the number engraved on the gold and using the lowest retail price from that year onward as the deemed acquisition cost, it may be accepted. For how to handle cases where the acquisition cost is unknown, it is advisable to consult with a tax office or a tax accountant. Furthermore, if the sale price of gold exceeds 2 million yen, submission of a My Number Card to the buyer is mandatory, and the transaction record will also be shared by the buyer with the tax office. This means that if you do not file a tax return, there is a high probability that the tax office will point out an undeclared income. Even if it's a bit troublesome, if a taxable amount arises from the sale of gold, be sure to declare it.

Daiwa believes that business conditions are steadily improving, and in the engineering business, which primarily involves lump-sum contracts, unforeseen profit and loss fluctuations always occur. The biggest characteristic, according to Daiwa, is that 'events that negate positive factors no longer occur.' On the other hand, due to the reduction in outstanding projects as large-scale projects are completed sequentially, it is difficult to expect an increase in operating profit for the next fiscal year, and the selection and securing of 'projects leading to the next' was pointed out as one of the challenges.

Mizuho pointed out that the probability of sustainable profit growth driven by DX/GX-related factors has further increased. As a result, it believes there is a possibility of another upward revaluation (=shift of the valuation base year to the future). Furthermore, looking towards 2026, it is also focusing on i) the possibility of re-accelerating business portfolio reform, primarily centered on CI, and ii) the progress of initiatives to expand digital service businesses in areas such as energy and railways through the utilization of digital technology. ★13:06 Cados - Surges temporarily in the afternoon session; receives large order worth approximately 1 billion yen.

This has already been incorporated into the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending July 2026. ★13:07 Skylark - Mizuho raises target price; revised profit guidance expected to be achievable. Skylark Holdings <3197> saw a significant rebound. Mizuho Securities expects the revised profit guidance to be achievable. It maintained its 'Neutral' investment rating and raised its target price from 2,850 yen to 3,150 yen. Mizuho revised its earnings forecast based on the Q3 FY2025/12 results. While an upward revision to guidance was announced at the time of the Q3 results, the Q4 plan largely remained at the initial plan, suggesting potential for upside in terms of profit. While Mizuho evaluates the shift from a conventional cost-cutting-focused policy to a store-centric management policy, it continues to view the stock as lacking a sense of undervaluation in terms of stock price indicators. The monthly sales of 'Sukesan Udon' are said to be about three times higher than existing brands, boasting strong customer attraction.

The rapid depreciation of the yen in the foreign exchange market is seen as a tailwind for the company's shares, which stand out among manufacturers for their high sensitivity to exchange rates. Currently, the dollar-yen rate is around 155 yen to the dollar, and the euro-yen rate is around 180 yen to the euro. However, the company's assumed full-year exchange rates for the fiscal year ending March 2026 are 146 yen to the dollar and 169 yen to the euro, respectively. With the yen significantly weaker than these assumptions, the company is expected to benefit from exchange rate gains. Furthermore, the company announced on the 18th that it would invest a total of 912 million dollars, or approximately 140 billion yen, in five plants in the U.S. to strengthen local production of hybrid vehicles (HVs), which are selling well in the U.S. This also appears to have stimulated the stock price.■Shimano <7309> 14,930 yen -500 yen (-3.2%) Closing price today Shimano <7309> fell for the third consecutive day. After the close of trading on the 18th, the company announced that it would cancel 1.18 million of its own shares (1.35% of outstanding shares before cancellation) effective November 26, but this move appears to have had a limited positive impact. The number of outstanding shares after cancellation will be 86.53 million.■Kyokuyo <1301> 4,570 yen -85 yen (-1.8%) Closing price today Fishery stocks such as Kyokuyo <1301>, Maruha Nichiro <1333>, and Nissui <1332> all turned negative in the afternoon session. Selling emerged due to concerns about the impact on earnings after Kyodo News reported in the afternoon that 'the Chinese government informed the Japanese government on the 19th that it would halt imports of Japanese marine products.' Additionally, Yoshimura Food Holdings <2884>, which handles scallop export and sales business within its group, also plummeted.■Advantest <6857> 19,150 yen -110 yen (-0.6%) Closing price today Semiconductor manufacturing equipment-related stocks such as Advantest <6857> and Disco <6146> saw mixed buying and selling, but were somewhat pressured by selling. In the U.S. stock market on the previous day, AI-related stocks and the semiconductor sector faced strong selling pressure, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, fell 2.3% for the fourth consecutive day, intensifying its search for lower support. Ahead of the earnings announcement for the August-October 2025 period by U.S. graphics processing semiconductor giant Nvidia on the 19th local time (early morning of the 20th Japan time), a wait-and-see mood intensified due to speculation about wanting to assess the content. This trend has also spread to the Tokyo market, but it is a difficult time for immediate buying, especially for Advantest, which has Nvidia as a major customer, and Disco, which is shifting its management strategy to target the generative AI market.",Stock Search News

円 (+5.1％)　　11:30現在日本ビジネスシステムズ<5036>は高い。前週末２１日取引終了後、自社株買いを実施すると発表した。取得上限は１２０万株（自己株式を除く発行済み株式総数の２．６３％）、または２４億円。期間は１１月２５日～来年２月２８日。これが好感されている。■アドバンテスト<6857>19,205円　+890 円 (+4.9％)　　11:30現在アドバンテスト<6857>が反発、一時１０３５円高の１万９３５０円まで上昇する場面があった。前日の米国株市場では半導体関連株が軒並み上昇し、半導体銘柄で構成されるフィラデルフィア半導体株指数（ＳＯＸ指数）は４．６％高と急騰した。ただ、ＡＩ半導体関連株のシンボルストックであるエヌビディアは２％強の上昇にとどまり、７５日移動平均線を上回れずに取引を終えた。市場ではグーグルが開発した最先端ＡＩモデル「Ｇｅｍｉｎｉ（ジェミニ）３」への期待が大きい一方、同モデルは高性能だけでなく低コストを売り物としており、エヌビディアの最先端ＧＰＵブラックウェルなどへのニーズが中期的に低下するのではないかとの思惑も錯綜している。エヌビディアを主要顧客とするアドテストにとってもネガティブに作用する可能性があるだけに、上値追いにやや慎重となっている面もあるようだ。アドテストは前週末に２５００円強の急落をみせており、きょうはその半値戻しにも満たない状況となっている。■日本毛織<3201>1,764円　+70 円 (+4.1％)　　11:30現在日本毛織<3201>は３日続伸している。前週末２１日の取引終了後、自社株２００万株（消却前の発行済み株式総数の２．６２％）を１１月２８日付で消却すると発表した。消却後の発行済み株式総数は７４２７万８８５８株となる。同時に期末配当予想は従来見通しから５円増額の３０円（前期の期末配当は２４円）にすると開示した。年間配当予想は４７円（前期は４０円）となる。株式需給の引き締まりと前向きな株主還元姿勢を評価した買いが入っている。■ＮＩＳＳＨＡ<7915>1,180円　+42 円 (+3.7％)　　11:30現在ＮＩＳＳＨＡ<7915>は反発。前週末２１日取引終了後、１２月４日付で２８３万９５３８株（発行済み株式総数の５．５８％）の自社株を消却すると発表した。将来の株式の希薄化懸念の払拭と浮動株比率の向上を図るため。これが手掛かりとなっているようだ。■島津製作所<7701>4,502円　+144 円 (+3.3％)　　11:30現在島津製作所<7701>は続伸。ＳＭＢＣ日興証券が２１日付で投資評価を「２（中立）」から「１（アウトパフォーム）」へ、目標株価を４２００円から５５００円へ引き上げたことが材料視されている。同証券によると、計測機器市場における米国の関税影響や政府予算縮小、中国の軟調な市況の影響は概ね出尽くし、今後の不透明感は払拭され始めていると指摘。米中印の計測機器シェア拡大と、新製品や消耗品増による収益性の改善により、業界平均を上回る売り上げ・営業利益成長が期待できるという。■トーメンデバイス<2737>10,800円　+270 円 (+2.6％)　　11:30現在トーメンデバイス<2737>が反発している。同社は２１日取引終了後、韓国の人工知能（ＡＩ）スタートアップ企業であるモビリントと両社間における製品プロモーション及び協業関係拡大を目的とした覚書（ＭＯＵ）を締結したと発表。これが買い手掛かりとなっているようだ。同社は、モビリントのオンプレミス、オンデバイス向け高性能ＡＩプロセッサー（ＮＰＵソリューション）技術によって、低消費電力で従来のプロセッサーの性能不足によって生じるＡＩ市場のさまざまな課題解決に向け共同プロモーションを開始。主な協業内容としては、「日本市場における潜在的な事業の可能性を探り、共同でマーケットの調査・創出」「技術・ノウハウ・マーケティング情報を共有し、新しいビジネスモデルの創出、協業のためのタスクチームを創設」「日本市場での販売・製品開発の連携など相互利益につながる新たな協力関係の創出」などとなっている。■さくらインターネット<3778>3,080円　+70 円 (+2.3％)　　11:30現在さくらインターネット<3778>は堅調。英運用会社のオービス・インベストメント・マネジメントが２１日付で関東財務局に提出した大量保有報告書で、さくらネット株を５．３０％取得したことが判明した。保有目的は「当社の管理下にあるファンドの資産運用のための投資」としている。報告義務発生日は１１月１４日。■みずほＦＧ<8411>5,183円　+20 円 (+0.4％)　　11:30現在みずほフィナンシャルグループ<8411>が堅調。日本経済新聞・電子版は２２日に日銀の増一行審議委員が利上げ判断に関して「近づいている」と述べたと報道した。同氏は「利上げをしていい環境は整ってきていると思う」と発言したという。日銀は、年内は１２月１８～１９日に、新年は１月２２～２３日に金融政策決定会合を予定しているが、追加利上げ思惑から銀行株に対する買いが流入している。■コンヴァノ<6574>110円　-14 円 (-11.3％)　　11:30現在コンヴァノ<6574>は５日ぶり反落。前週末２１日取引終了後、２６年３月期連結業績予想の修正を発表。売上高を１２３億７０００万円から１４９億５０００万円（前期比４．６倍）へ上方修正した一方、営業利益を６５億３５００万円から５９億９０００万円（前期１億３５００万円）へ下方修正した。ビットコインを用いたトレジャリー偏重から、本業起点の事業成長とＭ＆Ａ・成長投資を重視する財務戦略に軸足を移す方針へ戦略を見直し、この影響を織り込んだ。足もとの受注や販売動向なども踏まえた。利益の下振れ見通しが嫌気されている。■ソフトバンクグループ<9984>15,980円　-1,110 円 (-6.5％)　　11:30現在　東証プライム下落率トップソフトバンクグループ<9984>が軟調展開。前週末に２０００円あまりの急落に見舞われたが、きょうは先物主導のインデックス買いや空売り筋のショートカバーなどを誘導しているが上値が重い。前日の米国株市場ではハイテク株比率の高いナスダック総合株価指数が２．７％高と大幅高に買われたほか、半導体銘柄で構成されるフィラデルフィア半導体株指数（ＳＯＸ指数）は４．６％高と急騰した。米ハイテク企業に積極投資するソフトバンクＧにとっては足もとで追い風となる。ただ、米ハイテク株高を牽引したのはグーグルを傘下におくアルファベットで、同社の開発した最先端ＡＩモデル「Ｇｅｍｉｎｉ（ジェミニ）３」への高評価が同社株を押し上げ、全体リスクオン相場にも貢献する形となったが、ジェミニ３は高性能かつ低コストを売り物としており、「ＡＩデータセンターへの過剰投資に警鐘を鳴らす材料ともなり得る」（証券系アナリスト）という指摘もある。ソフトバンクＧの株価に、マイナスに働く可能性も指摘される。■ナカニシ<7716>1,948円　-95 円 (-4.7％)　　11:30現在ナカニシ<7716>は反落。ＳＭＢＣ日興証券が２１日付で投資評価を「１（アウトパフォーム）」から「２（中立）」へ、目標株価を３０００円から２４００円へ引き下げたことが売り材料視されている。同証券によると、情勢不透明感から２５年１２月期に未消化だった先行投資費用増が２６年１２月期に発生するシナリオを想定。加えて、米国歯科用ハンドピースの市場シェア増が従来想定よりも緩やかになっている点、買収した歯科チェアを販売するＤＣＩのＤＳＯ向け販売と市場開拓の遅れ、中国メーカーとの競合リスクも指摘した。■岡部<5959>910円　-17 円 (-1.8％)　　11:30現在岡部<5959>は３日ぶりに反落している。前週末２１日の取引終了後、株式の売り出しを決議したと発表しており、株式需給の悪化が警戒された。みずほフィナンシャルグループ<8411>傘下のみずほ銀行と三菱ＵＦＪフィナンシャル・グループ<8306>傘下の三菱ＵＦＪ銀行がそれぞれ１００万株、合計２００万株を売り出すとしており、これを嫌気した売りが出ている。需要状況に応じて上限３０万株のオーバーアロットメントによる売り出しも予定する。売出価格は１２月２日から４日までのいずれかの日に決める。あわせて岡部は自社株２００万株（発行済み株式総数の４．０６％）を１２月１０日に消却する予定だと発表した。■免疫生物研究所<4570>1,719円　+300 円 (+21.1％) ストップ高　　11:30現在免疫生物研究所<4570>への物色人気が加速、３００円高はストップ高となる１７１９円に張り付いている。ここ短期間で株価を３倍化させるなどマーケットの注目を集めていたが、モメンタム相場の典型で前週末２１日は乱高下、朝方に約３００円安まで売り込まれた後に切り返し、一時２００円以上の上昇を見せたが、その後再び軟化するなど高値波乱の様相を呈した。今月１２日に熊本大学、医薬基盤・健康・栄養研究所、ＣＵＲＥＤ（熊本市）と出願していた「抗ＨＩＶ抗体及びその製造方法」について、米国特許庁から特許査定の通知を受領したことを発表しており、これを材料に大相場となったが、時価は需給相場の色が濃い。直近では前週後半に貸株市場を通じた空売りが急増しており、この買い戻しが株価を押し上げる格好となっているもようだ。■インタートレード<3747>790円　+83 円 (+11.7％)　　11:30現在インタートレード<3747>は大幅高で４日続伸。この日午前１０時２５分ごろ、２６年９月期連結業績予想について純利益を８０００万円から２億４０００万円（前期１億４５００万円の赤字）へ上方修正すると発表した。これが好感されている。持ち分法適用会社のデジタルアセットマーケッツが複数の国内企業を引受先とする増資を行ったことに伴い、持ち分変動利益が発生することになったため。なお、売上高、営業利益見通しに変更はない。■アスカネット<2438>370円　+35 円 (+10.5％)　　11:30現在アスカネット<2438>が大幅高となっている。前週末２１日の取引終了後、取得総数６０万株（自己株式を除く発行済み株式総数の３．８６％）、取得総額２億円を上限とする自社株買いの実施を発表しており、株主還元姿勢を好感した買いが集まっている。取得期間は１２月１１日から来年４月２２日まで。■メディア総研<9242>2,167円　+400 円 (+22.6％) ストップ高買い気配　　11:30現在メディア総研<9242>がカイ気配スタートで３連騰。同社は高校生や大学生向けの就職活動イベントの企画・運営を手掛けているが、足もとの業績は拡大トレンドが顕著だ。株価は今月に入って急動意、１２日の取引時間中に２５３７円まで一気に水準を切り上げたものの、その後は一転して急反落に転じ、ほぼ往って来いの状況となっていた。前週後半に売り物が切れ下げ止まり、きょうは改めて買いに勢いがついている。前週末２１日取引終了後、同社は株主優待制度を導入することを発表した。毎年１月末と７月末時点で２００株以上を保有する株主を対象に、株主優待ポイント(保有株数に応じて３０００～２万５０００ポイント)を年２回付与、優待ポイントは株主限定の特設ウェブサイトで、グルメ、家電製品、体験ギフトなど５０００種類以上の商品から交換可能であり、これを材料視する投資資金が集中した。●ストップ高銘柄ハンワホームズ<275A>605円　+100

■Japan Business Systems <5036> 1,457 yen +70 yen (+5.1%) As of 11:30 AM. Japan Business Systems <5036> is trading higher. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would conduct a share buyback. The upper limit for acquisition is 1.2 million shares (2.63% of the total outstanding shares excluding treasury stock), or 2.4 billion yen. The period is from November 25th to February 28th next year. This has been well-received.
■Advantest <6857> 19,205 yen +890 yen (+4.9%) As of 11:30 AM. Advantest <6857> rebounded, at one point rising by 1,035 yen to 19,350 yen. In the U.S. stock market yesterday, semiconductor-related stocks rose across the board, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, surged by 4.6%. However, Nvidia, a symbolic stock among AI semiconductor-related companies, only rose by a little over 2% and closed trading without surpassing its 75-day moving average. While there are high expectations in the market for ""Gemini 3,"" the cutting-edge AI model developed by Google, this model is touted not only for its high performance but also for its low cost. This has led to mixed speculation that demand for Nvidia's cutting-edge GPUs like Blackwell might decline in the medium term. Given that this could negatively impact Advantest, which has Nvidia as a major customer, there seems to be some caution in pursuing further upside. Advantest saw a sharp decline of over 2,500 yen last Friday, and today's rise is less than half of that recovery.
■Nippon Keori <3201> 1,764 yen +70 yen (+4.1%) As of 11:30 AM. Nippon Keori <3201> has risen for three consecutive days. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would cancel 2 million treasury shares (2.62% of the total outstanding shares before cancellation) on November 28th. The total outstanding shares after cancellation will be 74,278,858 shares. At the same time, it disclosed that the year-end dividend forecast would be increased by 5 yen from the previous outlook to 30 yen (the previous fiscal year's year-end dividend was 24 yen). The annual dividend forecast will be 47 yen (40 yen in the previous fiscal year). Buying is coming in, evaluating the tightening of stock supply and demand and the positive stance on shareholder returns.
■NISSHA <7915> 1,180 yen +42 yen (+3.7%) As of 11:30 AM. NISSHA <7915> rebounded. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would cancel 2,839,538 treasury shares (5.58% of the total outstanding shares) on December 4th. This is aimed at dispelling concerns about future stock dilution and improving the free-float ratio. This appears to be the catalyst.
■Shimadzu Corporation <7701> 4,502 yen +144 yen (+3.3%) As of 11:30 AM. Shimadzu Corporation <7701> continued to rise. The stock is being driven by SMBC Nikko Securities raising its investment rating from ""2 (Neutral)"" to ""1 (Outperform)"" and its target price from 4,200 yen to 5,500 yen on the 21st. According to the securities firm, the impact of U.S. tariffs, reduced government budgets, and a sluggish market in China on the measuring instrument market has largely run its course, and future uncertainties are beginning to dissipate. It expects sales and operating profit growth above the industry average due to expanding market share for measuring instruments in the U.S., China, and India, and improved profitability from new products and increased consumables.
■Tomen Devices <2737> 10,800 yen +270 yen (+2.6%) As of 11:30 AM. Tomen Devices <2737> has rebounded. After the close of trading on the 21st, the company announced it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Mobilint, a South Korean artificial intelligence (AI) startup, aimed at product promotion and expanding their collaborative relationship. This appears to be a buying catalyst. The company has begun joint promotion to solve various challenges in the AI market caused by the performance limitations of conventional processors, using Mobilint's high-performance AI processor (NPU solution) technology for on-premise and on-device applications, which offers low power consumption. Key areas of collaboration include: ""Exploring potential business opportunities in the Japanese market and jointly conducting market research and creation,"" ""Sharing technology, know-how, and marketing information to create new business models and establish a task team for collaboration,"" and ""Creating new cooperative relationships that lead to mutual benefits, such as sales and product development collaboration in the Japanese market.""
■Sakura Internet <3778> 3,080 yen +70 yen (+2.3%) As of 11:30 AM. Sakura Internet <3778> is firm. It was revealed in a large shareholding report submitted to the Kanto Local Finance Bureau by British asset management company Orbis Investment Management on the 21st that it had acquired 5.30% of Sakura Internet shares. The purpose of the holding is stated as ""investment for asset management of funds under our management."" The obligation to report arose on November 14th.
■Mizuho FG <8411> 5,183 yen +20 yen (+0.4%) As of 11:30 AM. Mizuho Financial Group <8411> is firm. The Nikkei Shimbun's online edition reported on the 22nd that Bank of Japan Policy Board member Hajime Takata stated that the decision on interest rate hikes is ""approaching."" He reportedly said, ""I believe the environment is becoming ready for an interest rate hike."" The Bank of Japan has scheduled Monetary Policy Meetings for December 18-19 this year and January 22-23 next year, and buying is flowing into bank stocks due to speculation of additional rate hikes.
■Convano <6574> 110 yen -14 yen (-11.3%) As of 11:30 AM. Convano <6574> declined for the first time in five days. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced a revision to its consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026. While net sales were revised upward from 12.37 billion yen to 14.95 billion yen (4.6 times the previous fiscal year), operating profit was revised downward from 6.535 billion yen to 5.99 billion yen (135 million yen in the previous fiscal year). The company revised its strategy to shift its financial focus from treasury-heavy operations using Bitcoin to a strategy emphasizing business growth from its core operations and M&A/growth investments, and this impact has been incorporated. Current order and sales trends were also taken into account. The downward revision of profit outlook is being viewed negatively.
■SoftBank Group <9984> 15,980 yen -1,110 yen (-6.5%) As of 11:30 AM. Top decliner on TSE Prime. SoftBank Group <9984> is showing weak performance. While it suffered a sharp decline of over 2,000 yen last Friday, today's trading is seeing futures-led index buying and short covering by short sellers, but the upside remains heavy. In the U.S. stock market yesterday, the Nasdaq Composite Index, which has a high proportion of tech stocks, was bought up significantly, rising 2.7%, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, surged by 4.6%. This provides a tailwind for SoftBank Group, which actively invests in U.S. tech companies. However, the surge in U.S. tech stocks was led by Alphabet, Google's parent company, whose cutting-edge AI model ""Gemini 3"" received high praise, boosting its stock and contributing to the overall risk-on market. But Gemini 3 is touted for both high performance and low cost, leading some (securities analysts) to point out that it ""could also serve as a warning against excessive investment in AI data centers."" It is also pointed out that this could negatively impact SoftBank Group's stock price.
■Nakanishi <7716> 1,948 yen -95 yen (-4.7%) As of 11:30 AM. Nakanishi <7716> declined. The stock is being sold off after SMBC Nikko Securities lowered its investment rating from ""1 (Outperform)"" to ""2 (Neutral)"" and its target price from 3,000 yen to 2,400 yen on the 21st. According to the securities firm, due to uncertain circumstances, it anticipates a scenario where increased upfront investment costs that were unspent in the fiscal year ending December 2025 will occur in the fiscal year ending December 2026. Additionally, it pointed out that the increase in market share for dental handpieces in the U.S. is slower than previously expected, there are delays in sales to DSOs (Dental Service Organizations) and market development for DCI, which sells acquired dental chairs, and there is a risk of competition with Chinese manufacturers.
■Okabe <5959> 910 yen -17 yen (-1.8%) As of 11:30 AM. Okabe <5959> declined for the first time in three days. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced a resolution for a secondary offering of shares, raising concerns about a deterioration in stock supply and demand. Mizuho Bank, a subsidiary of Mizuho Financial Group <8411>, and MUFG Bank, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306>, are each planning to sell 1 million shares, totaling 2 million shares, which has led to selling pressure. A secondary offering of up to 300,000 shares via over-allotment is also planned, depending on demand. The offering price will be determined on one of the days between December 2nd and 4th. Additionally, Okabe announced it plans to cancel 2 million treasury shares (4.06% of the total outstanding shares) on December 10th.
■Immuno-Biological Laboratories <4570> 1,719 yen +300 yen (+21.1%) Limit up As of 11:30 AM. Buying interest in Immuno-Biological Laboratories <4570> is accelerating, with the stock hitting its limit up at 1,719 yen, a gain of 300 yen. The stock had attracted market attention by tripling in a short period, but in a typical momentum play, it saw volatile trading last Friday, the 21st. After being sold down by about 300 yen in the morning, it rebounded, showing a temporary rise of over 200 yen, but then softened again, indicating high-price volatility. On the 12th of this month, the company announced it had received a notice of patent allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for ""Anti-HIV antibodies and methods for producing the same,"" which it had applied for jointly with Kumamoto University, the National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, and CURED (Kumamoto City). This news triggered a major rally, but the current price strongly reflects supply and demand dynamics. Recently, short selling through the stock lending market surged in the latter half of last week, and it appears that this short covering is pushing up the stock price.
■Intertrade <3747> 790 yen +83 yen (+11.7%) As of 11:30 AM. Intertrade <3747> surged, rising for four consecutive days. Around 10:25 AM today, the company announced an upward revision to its consolidated net profit forecast for the fiscal year ending September 2026, from 80 million yen to 240 million yen (compared to a loss of 145 million yen in the previous fiscal year). This has been well-received. This is due to a gain from changes in equity interest resulting from an increase in capital by its equity-method affiliate, Digital Asset Markets, with several domestic companies as underwriters. There are no changes to the net sales and operating profit forecasts.
■AscaNet <2438> 370 yen +35 yen (+10.5%) As of 11:30 AM. AscaNet <2438> is significantly higher. After the close of trading on Friday, the 21st, the company announced it would conduct a share buyback with an upper limit of 600,000 shares (3.86% of the total outstanding shares excluding treasury stock) or 200 million yen. Buying is gathering, favoring the company's stance on shareholder returns. The acquisition period is from December 11th to April 22nd next year.
■Media Souken <9242> 2,167 yen +400 yen (+22.6%) Bid-only limit up As of 11:30 AM. Media Souken <9242> started with a bid-only limit up and has risen for three consecutive days. The company plans and operates job-hunting events for high school and university students, and its current performance shows a clear expansion trend. The stock price moved sharply this month, surging to 2,537 yen during trading hours on the 12th, but then sharply reversed and declined, almost returning to its starting point. In the latter half of last week, selling pressure subsided, and today, buying momentum has picked up again. After the close of trading last Friday, the 21st, the company announced the introduction of a shareholder benefit program. Shareholders holding 200 or more shares as of the end of January and the end of July each year will receive shareholder benefit points (3,000 to 25,000 points depending on the number of shares held) twice a year. These points can be exchanged for over 5,000 types of products, including gourmet foods, home appliances, and experience gifts, on a special website exclusively for shareholders. Investment funds have concentrated on this news.

SMBC Nikko judged that its competitive advantage has not been undermined. It maintained its investment rating at ""1 (Outperform)"" and raised its target price from 5,900 yen to 6,000 yen. SMBC Nikko believes that there are still no signs of improvement in the U.S. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) market, making a short-term recovery difficult to expect. On the other hand, it assumes that improvement is highly likely from 2027 onwards due to the U.S. housing market returning to a growth trajectory. Regarding semiconductor materials, it judged that demand related to AI is increasingly likely to grow at a faster pace than previously expected. Considering the difference in profit margins with competitors, it believes that its competitive advantage in its core businesses has not been undermined, and taking into account the undervaluation of its valuation metrics, there is significant upside potential when an improvement in the external environment is factored in.

SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast based on the Q2 FY26.3 earnings announcement and subsequent interviews. The company's three pillars for addressing the Opdivo cliff are mitigating sales decline through Opdivo subcutaneous injection, growth of Deciphera products, and growth of in-house developed products. Among these, the current revision incorporates the successful Phase 2 trial of the next-generation immunotherapy ""ONO-4578"" for gastric cancer and the successful Phase 2 trial of the multiple system atrophy treatment ""ONO-2808"" in relation to the growth of in-house developed products.

SMBC Nikko raised its earnings forecast and target price based on the Q3 FY25.12 earnings announcement and the upward revision of the full-year company plan. It evaluated that the company's rental, income-generating real estate, and condominium sales businesses are progressing more favorably than expected, with accelerating increases in office rents and real estate prices against the backdrop of inflation. It believes that the likelihood of an upside deviation from the medium-term plan announced in January this year has increased.

""High-dividend stocks"" with high dividend yields are very popular. The basic strategy for high-dividend stocks is to hold them long-term and continue to receive dividends. Therefore, large-cap stocks with stable performance and a low risk of easily eliminating or reducing dividends provide peace of mind. Here, we will introduce two ""high-dividend stocks with a market capitalization of approximately 1 trillion yen or more and a dividend yield of 3% or more"" recommended by Kosuke Nishimura of Quant Research (※Stock prices and dividend yield data are as of November 4, 2025). The first one to be introduced is Toyota Motor Corporation (7203), with a market capitalization of 49,833.2 billion yen and a dividend yield of 3.0%. Toyota Motor Corporation is a world-leading automobile manufacturer, as is well known. Although the current fiscal year's earnings forecast anticipated a decrease in profit due to Trump tariffs, the company announced an upward revision for both sales and profit on November 5. The expected decline in profit is now projected to narrow. Automobile sales performance globally, including North America and China, is strong. The exchange rate is also trending weaker than the assumed 1 dollar = 146 yen, which is a factor boosting profits. The stock price feels like a laggard among major companies, and considering its brand power, the value of being a winner, and a dividend yield in the 3% range, it is rather considered a good buying opportunity. Next to be introduced is Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316), with a market capitalization of 16,082 billion yen and a dividend yield of 3.2%. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group centers around Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and SMBC Nikko Securities. Increased lending revenue and strong asset management are contributing to continuous record-high profits. Rising interest rates are also a tailwind. It is leading with ""Olive"" in mobile comprehensive financial services. While the stock price is near its all-time high with planned dividend increases for five consecutive periods, a PER of around 12 times does not suggest it is overvalued.

SMBC Nikko Securities pointed out that there is a lack of further equity story. They maintained their investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raised their target price from 4,400 yen to 5,300 yen. SMBC Nikko views the order intake plan for the second half of the fiscal year as somewhat conservative and expects full-year earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 to exceed forecasts. Additionally, they believe that operating profit growth is possible for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to improved demand accompanying lower US interest rates. On the other hand, they noted that momentum in automotive demand, a key customer for the company, is difficult to anticipate, and it is currently hard to find an equity story beyond an increase in sales volume, thus lacking further positive catalysts. While they stated that the stock price could rise strongly if a robust demand recovery due to the return of manufacturing to the US is confirmed, they are primarily looking forward to the disclosure of a medium-term management plan and ROE targets to identify an equity story.

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda stated on December 1 in a greeting at a financial and economic discussion meeting in Nagoya City that he ""would like to make an appropriate judgment on the advisability of a rate hike"" at the Monetary Policy Meeting on December 18-19. Following a series of these remarks, the market perceived an increased likelihood of a rate hike in December, which is supporting bank stocks, a sector that benefits from rising interest rates. Governor Ueda pointed out that the probability of the central outlook for the economy and prices being realized is gradually increasing, taking into account the recent decline in uncertainties surrounding the U.S. economy and tariff policies. He further stated that the BOJ is actively gathering information through its head office and branches regarding companies' stances on wage increases in preparation for the December policy meeting, and expressed his intention to review and discuss domestic and international economic and price conditions and financial capital market trends based on various data and information.■Anicom Holdings <8715> 896 yen +6 yen (+0.7%) Today's closing price.

If shareholder returns are strengthened to achieve 10% ROE for the fiscal year ending March 2028, the stock may appear more undervalued compared to past PER levels. ★13:13 AGC - SMBC Nikko raises target price; Continues to await growth recovery in strategic businesses AGC <5201> fell for the first time in 7 days. SMBC Nikko Securities stated that it continues to await the growth recovery of strategic businesses, maintaining its investment rating at ""2 (Neutral)"" and raising its target price from 4,200 yen to 4,300 yen. SMBC Nikko revised the applicable PER from 10.6x to 10.4x, reflecting changes in earnings contribution and multiples for each business. While the automotive segment reflected improved profitability due to the company's profit-focused stance, the chemicals segment reflected the stagnation of caustic soda and PVC markets in Southeast Asia. Towards the fiscal year ending December 2026, the withdrawal from the large tank business in life sciences and increased capacity in chemicals in Southeast Asia are expected to contribute to performance, but the focus will be on whether growth recovery can be seen in electronics, such as optoelectronics and EUV mask blanks.

Significant continued rise. Announced a collaboration with U.S. NVIDIA to promote ""Physical AI"" for robots. This will enable robots to understand human instructions and generate appropriate movements, as well as develop robots that can work while avoiding people. Furthermore, by supporting the open-source robot development environment ""ROS,"" developers worldwide will be able to create and utilize programs to operate the company's robots. Leveraging its track record as a global leader, the company anticipates increased growth expectations due to the expansion of the Physical AI market. < 6506 > Yaskawa Electric 4212 +188. Significant rebound. Announced a collaboration with SoftBank for the practical application of AI robots. By combining the company's AI robot technology with SoftBank's information processing technology, robots will be able to perform autonomous tasks safely even in environments with many unspecified people, such as office buildings. It appears they will also be introduced in hospitals, schools, and commercial facilities, playing a role in addressing labor shortages. With news of the FANUC-NVIDIA collaboration also circulating, the future expansion of the Physical AI market is rapidly anticipated. < 7092 > FFJ 2306 +123. Significant rebound. Announced plans to take the company private through an MBO. JG35, an asset management company of the founding family, which plans to invest, will conduct a Tender Offer (TOB) at 2,315 yen per share. The TOB price represents a 6.0% premium over the previous day's closing price, leading to a movement towards the TOB price. The TOB period is scheduled from the 2nd until January 20, 2026. Amid intensifying competition due to the increase in low-cost gyms, the company reportedly plans to accelerate new store openings by going private. < 3407 > Asahi Kasei 1272 +25. Significant rebound. Announced an agreement with Teijin to integrate their respective textile trading subsidiaries in October 2026. Teijin Frontier and Asahi Kasei Advance will merge, with Teijin Frontier as the surviving company. After the merger, Teijin will hold an 80% stake and Asahi Kasei will hold 20%. This development is expected to bring benefits such as economies of scale, and for Asahi Kasei, it will also enable the concentration of management resources into high-profit businesses like healthcare. Buying activity is leading for both companies, and for Asahi Kasei, there is also a rebound effect from the sharp decline towards the close of the previous day. < 4665 > Duskin 4258 +266. Significant rebound. Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities upgraded its investment rating from ""Underweight"" to ""Equal-weight"" and raised its target price from 2,800 yen to 4,300 yen. It pointed out that the increasing proportion of the food business, centered on Mister Donut, makes it easier to consider restaurant valuations, and it appears they have changed the applicable valuation metric from PBR to PER. Furthermore, reflecting the strong performance of existing Mister Donut stores, the company has also revised its earnings forecast upward. < 8306 > Mitsubishi UFJ 2523.5 +60.5. Significant continued rise. The banking sector is the second-highest gainer by industry today, continuing its upward trend. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda stated at a press conference the previous day that even with an interest rate hike, ""the situation is still accommodative,"" and expressed his intention to ""appropriately judge the necessity of an interest rate hike"" at the Monetary Policy Meeting to be held on the 18th-19th. In response, an additional interest rate hike at the December meeting is now strongly priced in. The yield on 10-year government bonds, a benchmark for long-term interest rates, temporarily rose to 1.880%, reaching its highest level in approximately 17 and a half years. < 7564 > Workman 6720 -260. Significant continued decline. Announced its monthly trends for November the previous day. Existing store sales increased by 7.9% year-on-year, a deceleration from the 19.5% increase in the previous month. Since the last monthly announcement, the stock price had been on an upward trend, so selling to close positions seems to be dominant due to the slowdown in the sales growth rate. The number of customers increased by 5.3%, and the average customer spend also rose by 2.5%, but both figures represent a slowdown compared to the previous month's growth. It appears that colder temperatures supported sales of winter clothing. < 2678 > Askul 1391 -32. Significant continued decline. Announced the postponement of its first-half financial results disclosure, which was scheduled for December 15. This is due to the suspension of orders on its e-commerce site following a cyberattack, and the time required to calculate the extent of the damage. The company also announced its monthly trends for November, with sales significantly down by 95% year-on-year, and a sharp decline in its consumer-向け ""LOHACO"" business. While this was somewhat anticipated, limiting the surprise, there is currently no clear timeline for the full recovery of LOHACO, which is being viewed as a negative factor. < 2593 > Ito En 3053 -120. Significant continued decline. Announced its first-half financial results the previous day, with operating profit at 13.9 billion yen, a 3.2% decrease year-on-year. This marks a shift from a 17.3% increase in the first quarter to a decline in profit, and market expectations are believed to have been missed by approximately 2 billion yen. There is also a view that the hurdle for achieving the unchanged full-year plan of 25.5 billion yen, an 11.0% increase from the previous fiscal year, has risen. The background is the deterioration in profitability of domestic beverages, where the impact of higher raw material and ingredient costs is significant, and the effect of price increases appears to be limited. < 3465 > KEIICHI STAR 6290 +230. Significant continued rise. SMBC Nikko Securities upgraded its investment rating from ""2"" to ""1"" and raised its target price from 5,500 yen to 7,300 yen. It believes there is a possibility of an upward revision being announced when the third-quarter financial results are released, and strong guidance can be expected for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to an increase in the number of condominium units sold. The background for the investment rating upgrade is also the upside in valuation based on ROE and the presence of short-term catalysts.",Fisco

The Nikkei Shimbun Digital Edition reported at 2:00 on the 2nd that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has decided to recommend that Suzuki's wholly-owned subsidiary, Snic, take measures to prevent recurrence, on the grounds that setting significantly low order prices for parts of automobiles whose mass production has ended constitutes a violation of the Subcontract Act (unjustly low pricing). According to the article, this was learned through interviews with related parties. It is said to be the first time that a violation of the Subcontract Act has been recognized regarding order prices for replacement parts, and each manufacturer may be forced to rationalize their transactions.

Nomura expects sales growth driven by domestic DX demand, in addition to improved profitability through the utilization of AI. Domestically, they anticipate steady business expansion in consulting and financial SaaS businesses, as well as a recovery in sales in industrial IT, where sales growth had been slowing due to investment restraint from large clients, high growth in security-related areas with strong demand, and improved profitability through AI utilization, primarily in financial IT. For the fiscal year ending March 2027, they forecast a 15% increase in operating profit year-on-year, driven by improved profitability through AI utilization, increased revenue in each business segment, and profit improvement due to the reduction of structural reform costs overseas and cost control.

Nomura pointed out that the operating profit of 7.9 billion yen for Q4 and the operating profit plan of 37.6 billion yen for the fiscal year ending September 2026 exceeded Nomura's previous forecasts. They believe that the planned 20% operating profit growth rate for the fiscal year ending September 2026 could be surpassed depending on upfront investments and cost management. It was commented that for the fiscal year ending September 2026, due to the impact of the departure of specific merchants, the operating profit growth rate for Q1 will slightly decelerate to 18% year-on-year, but is expected to improve to the 20% range from Q3 onwards. Payment demand is robust, a pipeline of large projects for PG alone is anticipated until the fiscal year ending September 2028, and the basis for calculating the operating profit target of 100 billion yen for 2030-31 has also been presented, suggesting that the company can be evaluated based on its medium- to long-term performance.

Daiwa expects consolidated net profit for the full fiscal year 2025 to be 1.5 trillion yen (a 27% increase year-on-year), achieving the bank's target. It was pointed out that while stock performance has been strong since the recent positive earnings announcement, the sense of being undervalued over the past year has not been corrected, and the stock still appears inexpensive based on various valuations. In preparation for the next medium-term management plan scheduled to start next fiscal year, the disposal of low-profit assets is expected to proceed this fiscal year, and the certainty of future profit growth is likely to increase. It is also expected that the consolidated ROE (long-term) target for the next medium-term management plan will be set at a level comparable to global peers, excluding gains from the sale of policy-held shares, indicating significant investment appeal for both the short and long term.",Traders Web

Nissan Chemical <4021> continued to rise. SMBC Nikko Securities expects growth driven by both semiconductor materials and agrochemicals. The investment rating was maintained at ""1 (Outperform),"" and the target price was raised from 6,300 yen to 6,500 yen. SMBC Nikko judged that the company's plan was revised upward, mainly for agrochemicals and semiconductor materials, in the Q2 financial results for the fiscal year ending March 2026, increasing the certainty of achieving record-high profits. In particular, the strong performance of semiconductor materials, led by advanced semiconductors, was notable, and the firm expects growth to continue to outpace the shipment area of silicon wafers. Furthermore, the new herbicide Verder, launched in the fiscal year ending March 2025, grew more than expected, reaffirming the company's strong new product development capabilities. For the fiscal year ending March 2027, while a decrease in revenue from the animal drug active ingredient fluralaner is likely to be a drag, SMBC Nikko expects the profit growth trend to continue, primarily driven by semiconductor materials and agrochemicals. The current low valuation metrics are believed to underestimate the company's R&D capabilities.★9:53 Rengo - SMBC Nikko raises target price, a phase where changes in awareness regarding capital policy begin to be factored in. Rengo <3941> rebounded for the first time in three days. SMBC Nikko Securities judged this to be a phase where changes in awareness regarding capital policy begin to be factored in. The investment rating was maintained at ""1 (Outperform),"" and the target price was raised from 1,070 yen to 1,300 yen. SMBC Nikko expects that for the fiscal year ending March 2026, due to delays in the recovery of domestic corrugated board demand and European heavy packaging materials, the second half's performance will fall below the company's plan as anticipated. On the other hand, the firm noted the emergence of new positive factors, such as improved performance of RM Higashi Cello, which was newly consolidated from the previous fiscal year in the flexible packaging sector, and the proactive capital policy, including an upward revision of the full-year dividend forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026. Considering that corrugated board price increases are expected to contribute to performance in the fiscal year ending March 2027, SMBC Nikko believes there is still room for a reevaluation of the stock price.★10:02 &ST - Fourth consecutive day of decline; Adastria's existing store sales up 1.2% in November, growth decelerates month-on-month. &ST HD <2685> fell for the fourth consecutive day. The company announced on the 2nd that Adastria's existing store sales for November increased by 1.2% year-on-year. This was a 3.2 percentage point decrease compared to the previous month. Total store sales increased by 4.3% year-on-year, a 3.3 percentage point decrease compared to the previous month.★10:04 Shiseido - SMBC Nikko lowers target price, concerns about worsening Japan-China relations remain. Shiseido <4911> fell for the third consecutive day. SMBC Nikko Securities pointed out that while the impairment loss in the Americas might suggest that all negative factors have been priced in, concerns about worsening Japan-China relations remain. The investment rating was maintained at ""2 (Neutral),"" and the target price was raised from 2,660 yen to 2,600 yen. SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast and target price based on the Q3 results for the fiscal year ending December 2025 and the new medium-term management plan. The firm commented that the new medium-term plan's growth strategy is unclear, and the impression that challenges remain in expanding global market share could not be dispelled. In the short term, attention is focused on whether flagship brands SHISEIDO and NARS can secure a growth trajectory that surpasses the European and American markets, and whether the fragrance portfolio can be further expanded with the launch of MaxMara. SMBC Nikko also pointed out that strengthening brands in the globally growing medical & derma sector is a challenge, and with high exposure to profits from China, concerns about boycotts stemming from worsening Japan-China relations are expected to weigh on stock price recovery in the short term.★10:10 Liberaware - Continued decline; Launches ""Torinos"" automated patrol camera. Liberaware <218A> continued to fall. The company announced on the 3rd that it would begin selling ""Torinos,"" an automated patrol camera that provides equipment maintenance DX, starting the same day. This product was developed with the aim of transforming patrol inspection operations in vast facilities. A camera unit traveling on rails remotely and automatically patrols within facilities, performing photography and recording, thereby significantly streamlining conventional manual inspections. This will enable the provision of equipment maintenance DX, starting with patrol inspections, for facilities such as large data centers, plants, tunnels, dam inspection galleries, and other tunnels. The positive impact on the stock price has been limited.★10:23 Ohsho Food - Trading sideways; November directly-managed existing store sales up 6%. Ohsho Food Service <9936> traded sideways. The company announced at 10:00 on the 3rd that preliminary directly-managed existing store sales for November increased by 6.4% year-on-year.

SMBC Nikko believes that in the short term, the stock price is likely to maintain a solid momentum due to progress in FDA inspections in the fiscal year ending March 2026, the fading of one-off factors, and expectations of personnel reduction effects towards the fiscal year ending March 2027. On the other hand, it is assumed that competition with Fujifilm will intensify in developed countries, and the rise of local manufacturers in China and India will become full-fledged from the next fiscal year onwards in emerging countries. The introduction of next-generation models is expected from the fiscal year ending March 2029 onwards, and SMBC Nikko believes this is a phase to assess the company's ability to respond to medium- to long-term risk factors.

Revenue is expected to increase due to an increase in inquiries resulting from strengthened operations of the portal site 'Seikatsu 110-ban' and vertical media sites specialized in various genres, enhanced cooperation with member stores, and an improvement in unit price per inquiry through optimized matching, as well as further expansion of genres and areas by group companies, including As Support. The company expects profit to increase by maintaining the current ratio of expenses to gross profit despite the increase in expenses accompanying the revenue growth.

Expectations are high for the disclosure of BBU business strategy at the business briefing on December 2. Mizuho believes that expectations will build towards the announcement of next fiscal year's plan and new medium-term management plan in May. For the current fiscal year, a slight upward revision is expected, with avionics, electronic components, and BBU compensating for the downside in automotive batteries, though it is still expected to fall slightly short of the company's plan.

Resonac Holdings <4004> rebounded. The company announced on the 1st that it has decided to reduce the workforce at its German domestic base for the graphite electrode business conducted by its grandchild company. Regarding the graphite electrode business, the company stated that the business environment has been severe due to sluggish demand trends and aggressive low-price sales by competitors, leading it to promote a series of rationalization measures globally, including facility closures. This time, it has decided to reduce the workforce at its German base in Europe to cut fixed costs. The company states that the costs and effects arising from the implementation of these measures are incorporated into the FY2025 earnings forecast based on certain assumptions, and there will be no change to the earnings outlook due to this resolution. As for the FY2026 earnings outlook, it has not yet been prepared, and the company plans to create guidance after incorporating the costs incurred and the cost reduction effects such as fixed costs. ★9:04 Mitsukoshi Isetan - Falls back; November domestic department store sales up 0.6%, domestic group department stores down 1.1%. Mitsukoshi Isetan Holdings <3099> fell back. The company announced on the 1st that its domestic department store sales for November, on a preliminary basis, increased by 0.6% year-on-year. Of these, Mitsukoshi Isetan's sales increased by 1.4%, while domestic group department stores saw a 1.1% decrease. With the drop in temperature, seasonal items such as coats, sweaters, and blousons made of high-quality materials like cashmere performed strongly. Furthermore, high-priced watches, where the company has strong product supply capabilities, saw growth among both domestic and international customers. ★9:04 Panasonic HD - Firm; Aims to quadruple sales of data center energy storage devices to 800 billion yen scale = Nikkei. Panasonic Holdings <6752> remained firm. The Nikkei Shimbun morning edition dated the 2nd reported that Panasonic Energy, a subsidiary of the company, aims to increase sales of energy storage systems for data centers to 800 billion yen by FY2028, quadrupling current sales. According to the article, the company's sales of energy storage systems for data centers in the fiscal year ending March 2025 were slightly less than 200 billion yen, and are expected to expand 1.7 times year-on-year in the fiscal year ending March 2026. To meet the robust demand for data centers, the company plans to reallocate some production capacity from its domestic and international factories that manufacture batteries for EVs. ★9:05 H2O Retailing - Trading flat; November department store total sales up 3.6%. H2O Retailing <8242> traded flat. The company announced on the 1st that its total department store sales for November, on a preliminary basis, increased by 3.6% year-on-year. Sales at urban stores, suburban stores, and all stores combined all exceeded the previous year's figures. While duty-free sales to Chinese customers exceeded the previous year on a monthly basis, the company stated that sales to tourist customers other than overseas VIPs significantly fell below the previous year in the latter half of November, decreasing by approximately 20%, partly due to rising tensions in Japan-China relations. ★9:05 Takashimaya - Trading flat; November domestic department store sales up 3.5%. Takashimaya <8233> traded flat. The company announced on the 1st that its domestic department store sales for November (preliminary figures) increased by 3.5% year-on-year. Duty-free sales decreased by 3.1%. Domestic customers showed movement in winter clothing such as coats due to the drop in temperature. For inbound customers, cosmetics and women's clothing saw positive growth compared to the previous year, while high-priced items, including luxury brands, saw negative growth. ★9:05 Yonex - Tokai Tokyo raises target price; Brand recognition improves, strong performance expected to continue. Yonex <7906> rebounded for the first time in four days. Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Lab expects brand recognition to improve and strong performance to continue. It maintained its ""Outperform"" rating and raised its target price from 3,200 yen to 4,000 yen. The company's performance for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September) showed double-digit increases in both revenue and operating profit year-on-year, with sales of 79.5 billion yen (up 18.8% year-on-year) and operating profit of 8.8 billion yen (up 15.0% year-on-year). Tokai Tokyo revised upward its earnings forecasts for the fiscal years ending March 2026 to March 2028. It anticipates growth in badminton products, particularly in Asia, and an increase in tennis products globally, believing that the stock price has not fully factored in the solid medium-to-long-term performance trend.

現在値 ソニーＧ 4,181 + 81 メガチプス 8,070 + 10 バンナムＨ 4,282 -20 任天堂 11,730 + 330.00 近鉄ＧＨＤ 2,961.5 + 39 ●バンナムは「ガンダム」IP好調も、下期の業績はダウントレンドか 先月に続いて、筆者がウォッチしている各企業の2026年3月期第2四半期（25年7-9月期）の決算動向をまとめていきたい。まずはゲームセクターである。バンダイナムコホールディングス < 7832 > の26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）は、前回の第1四半期（25年4-6月期）決算時に上方修正した数字を上回る形で着地し、前年同期比7％の営業減益ながらも比較的堅調な決算だった。筆者が第１四半期決算時に述べたように、「機動戦士ガンダム」シリーズの好調が大きな要因となっている。テレビアニメ「機動戦士Gundam GQuuuuuuX（ガンダムジークアクス）」が人気となったことや、大阪・関西万博での展示が好評だったからである。第1四半期時に「ガンダム関連のIP（知的財産）の売上高は2000億円に迫りそうだ」と想定したが、今回の決算での会社発表ではさらにそれを上回り、2300億円に上方修正されている。上期までの好調に合わせて通期計画も上方修正されたものの、26年3月期通期では上期同様に減益計画である。これは下期にゲームソフトの大型タイトルが予定されていないこと、万博効果の剥落などが想定されているためである。グループ会社が運営する動画配信サービス「バンダイチャンネル」が不正アクセスで停止している問題も含めて、下期の業績は若干、ダウントレンドになるのではないかという見方もあり、株価的にはネガティブに受け止められているようだ。ただ、中長期的には多彩なIPを持つ同社の業績は世界的なアニメ文化の広がりもあって、アニメやゲームを中心に拡大傾向が続くと見ている。次にソニーグループ < 6758 > の決算だが、26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）は非常に良かった。「プレイステーション（PS）5」のハード販売は依然として前モデル「PS4」のペースを下回っているものの、継続的な課金収入を得るリカーリングビジネスが全体的に好調で、オンラインサービスの堅調さもあり、ゲーム事業の利益は安定的に創出されている。孫会社のアニプレックスが手掛ける劇場版アニメ「鬼滅の刃」最新作に加え、実写映画の「国宝」も邦画としては異例のヒットとなっており、同グループのコンテンツ企業としての地位は高まっていると言えるだろう。スマートフォン（スマホ）用のCMOSセンサーも含めて、文句のない好決算だったと捉えている。今回の決算で同社は通期業績予想を上方修正したが、CMOSセンサーは顧客企業のスマホの販売好調が伝えられていることもあり、さらなる上振れも期待できそうだ。●日本のゲームユーザーの間でプレステへの関心が低下した理由もうひとつ、 前回も触れたが、ソニーグループは「PS5デジタル・エディション」の日本語専用モデルで実質的に大幅な値下げを行った。だが「ファミ通」が調査している販売データを見る限り、任天堂 < 7974 > の新型ゲーム機「Switch2」に迫ることはできなかった。これは同モデルにディスクドライブが装着されていないことで、ディスクドライブを使うかもしれないと考えるユーザーたちから、「買うに至らない」と思われてしまったことが要因のようだ。一部のメディアが頑張って盛り上げようとしているのとは裏腹に、「プレイステーション」に対するユーザーの関心が低下しているように筆者には思えてならない。この大幅値下げにも関わらず、「Switch2」に大きく後れを取った週販の結果を見れば、かつて筆者が予想していた「『プレイステーション』ブランドは凋落する」という説が正しかった、と言わざるを得ない。同社に取材しても、日本のシェアが低いことがこの国内専用モデル発売の要因だとしていたので、危機感はあるのだと思う。だが、私が指摘したことをもっと真剣に受け止めて対処していたら違う結果になったのではないか、というのが本音である。当時、日本ではスマホゲームが隆盛で、世界市場の約半分を占める米国市場が活況となると、同社が日本市場を軽視したくなるのも無理はなかったとは思う。米国市場開拓への戦略をシビアに立てる一方、日本や欧州では競合としては比較的戦いやすいマイクロソフトばかりを意識してきた経営が、日本市場での「プレイステーション」の存在感低下を招いてしまったのではないかと考えざるを得ない。幸い同社全体の業績は堅調で資金力もある。ぜひ、ゲーム事業でも日本市場の立て直しにまい進してもらいたいものだ。●AIブームの負の側面、半導体不足でゲーム機や電子機器の価格が上昇電子部品、半導体ではメガチップス < 6875 > の26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）決算に触れておきたい。同社はゲーム機用のソフト格納用半導体が主力だが、過去に投資し、持ち株を一部売却した米企業、サイタイム（SiTime）の株価が大きく上昇しているため話題になっている。サイタイムはタイミングデバイスという電子機器に欠かせない部品を供給しており、AI（人工知能）ブームで人気になった銘柄である。持ち株比率は徐々に下がっているのだが、サイタイムの株価上昇によってメガチップスの資産価値は逆に上昇しており、11月末に26年3月期通期の純利益を上方修正している。これは前回計画よりも高い価格でサイタイムの株式を売却できたことが要因のようだ。AI関連では、先月も触れたように、米ハイテク大手企業によって ""驚愕""と言えるほどの巨額の設備投資が行われており、GPU（画像処理半導体）だけでなく、DRAMやフラッシュメモリー、HDD（ハードディスクドライブ）など、多くの電子部材が需給バランスを崩している。すでに自作パソコン用のメモリーでも、店頭での販売制限が行われるようになっているほどだ。まだ読者の方々には実感が乏しいと思うのだが、AIへの巨額投資がこのまま続くなら、来年はゲームセクターにもかなり大きな影響が出そうな雰囲気である。「PS5」は24年に部材を安く調達できたらしく値下げを繰り返したが、今後は不透明だ。「Switch2」もDRAM、フラッシュメモリーともに前モデルの「Switch」よりも使用量が増えており、トランプ関税の影響も考えると、価格情勢が不透明になっている。「Switch2」はこのままメモリーなどの価格が上がりコスト負担が増すような事態になると、26年の販売台数が増えるほど、損失が出るような状況も想定しないといけないと思う。特に「Switch2」の2年目である26年は、適切な施策で販売台数を大きく伸ばしたいタイミングでもある。任天堂は価格と調達量をよく考える必要があろう。日本では需要が強く、多少の値上げは容認されると思われる。新たなカラーリングなどの施策に合わせて、値上げも考えないといけない局面もあり得よう。ゲーム機を例に挙げたが、AIブームはスマホやパソコンなどの価格にも大きな影響を及ぼしているように思う。筆者も生成AIは試していて、その成果物を見れば確かに性能の高さは理解できるのだが、半面、マネタイズはいま一つうまくいっていない印象がある。ブームを本物に変えられるかが26年後半以降に問われることになるだろう。●人気Vチューバーのイベントで盛り上がる近鉄に期待鉄道セクターでは近鉄グループホールディングス < 9041 > を取り上げたい。26年3月期上期（25年4-9月期）決算自体には大きなサプライズはなかったものの、万博効果は期初計画の125億円を大きく上回る250億円となる見込みだという。これほど好調だと下期以降の影響が懸念されるのだが、前回もお伝えした通り、志摩スペイン村で3回目となる、にじさんじ（ＡＮＹＣＯＬＯＲ（エニーカラー） < 5032 > 運営の人気Vチューバーグループ）所属の周央サンゴさんを中心とした「七次元生徒会」のイベントが実施されている。筆者も先日、志摩スペイン村を訪れたのだが、平日ながら若い人たちを、スペイン村最寄りの鵜方駅で多数見かけたので、改めてVチューバー人気の高さを確認した次第である。三重交通（三重交通グループホールディングス < 3232 > 傘下）が志摩スペイン村へのバスを大幅に増発するなど、以前の閑散としたイメージとは打って変わった印象だ。近鉄グループによると、今回のイベントの初動来場者は、前回に比べて大幅に増えたそうで、動画コンテンツ一本の力で、ここまで集客に変化を生む時代がやってきたというのは感慨深い。同社の伊勢志摩特急の利用も堅調とのことなので、将来性も含めて楽しみである。ところで鉄道セクターでは、日中関係が急速に悪化したことによるインバウンドの減少が懸念材料として挙げられている。もちろん、今後の動向は注視する必要があるだろうが、筆者は大幅な減少は想定していない。初期の頃のインバウンドに比べると多様化も進んでいて、中国の旅行者頼りの状況ではなくなっているからだ。最後にJR九州 < 9142 > にも改めて触れておきたい。26年3月期第2四半期（25年7-9月期）決算については前回すでに述べたが、11月に「JR博多シティ」に開店した「Nintendo FUKUOKA（ニンテンドーフクオカ）」が大いに盛り上がっているのである。オープン初日は午前5時から並ぶ人が現れたそうで、マグカップ付きのホットチョコレートの販売も期間限定で行われ、これも大盛況だった。SNSでは整理券配布の混乱や転売などの問題も見られたようだが、筆者はこれらによって人気の高さを再確認できたと考えている。むしろこうした事象がメディアで取り上げられたことで、全国的に「JR博多シティ」の知名度向上につながったのではないだろうか。鉄道会社はどうしても沿線の顧客を重視しがちであるが、テナント販売からの収益も大きな収益源である。地域ローカルの需要だけでなく、首都圏を含めた広範な人の動きを引き込むことで、さらに成長を図ることができるのではないかと考えている。各社の決算は総じて良好だったが、相場全体を見渡せば、現時点では株価的にはAI銘柄に偏りがあるのは確かだと思う。そのすそ野が広がるかどうかが、バブルか否かの分かれ目だと考えている。今後も各社の動向を追って、お伝えしていきたい。","Hideki Yasuda (Toyo Securities Analyst) Current Price: Sony G 4,181 + 81, MegaChips 8,070 + 10, Bandai Namco H 4,282 -20, Nintendo 11,730 + 330.00, Kintetsu GHD 2,961.5 + 39. ●Bandai Namco's ""Gundam"" IP is strong, but will second-half performance trend downwards? Following last month, I would like to summarize the earnings trends for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (July-September 2025) for the companies I am watching. First, the game sector. Bandai Namco Holdings <7832>'s first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025) exceeded the figures revised upward during the previous first quarter (April-June 2025) earnings announcement, resulting in a relatively solid performance despite a 7% year-on-year decrease in operating profit. As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings announcement, the strong performance of the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" series is a major factor. This is due to the popularity of the TV anime ""Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX"" and the favorable reception of its exhibition at the Osaka-Kansai Expo. While I had estimated during the first quarter that ""sales of Gundam-related IP (intellectual property) would approach 200 billion yen,"" the company's announcement in this earnings report further exceeded that, revising it upward to 230 billion yen. Although the full-year plan was also revised upward in line with the strong first-half performance, the full fiscal year ending March 2026 is still projected to see a decrease in profit, similar to the first half. This is because no major game software titles are scheduled for the second half, and the fading effect of the Expo is anticipated. Including the issue of the video streaming service ""Bandai Channel,"" operated by a group company, being suspended due to unauthorized access, there is a view that second-half performance might trend slightly downwards, which seems to be negatively perceived by the stock market. However, in the medium to long term, I believe the company's performance, with its diverse IP portfolio, will continue to expand, primarily driven by anime and games, supported by the global spread of anime culture. Next, regarding Sony Group <6758>'s earnings, the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025) was very strong. Although hardware sales of ""PlayStation (PS) 5"" are still below the pace of its predecessor ""PS4,"" recurring revenue businesses, which generate continuous subscription income, are generally strong, and robust online services are contributing to stable profit generation in the game business. In addition to the latest animated film ""Demon Slayer"" produced by its subsidiary Aniplex, the live-action film ""National Treasure"" has also become an unusual hit for a Japanese film, indicating that the group's position as a content company is strengthening. I view this as an unblemished strong earnings report, including CMOS sensors for smartphones. The company revised its full-year earnings forecast upward in this report, and with strong sales reported for customer companies' smartphones, further upside for CMOS sensors can be expected. ●Reasons for declining interest in PlayStation among Japanese game users. Another point, which I also touched upon last time, is that Sony Group effectively made a significant price reduction for the ""PS5 Digital Edition"" with a Japan-exclusive model. However, looking at the sales data surveyed by ""Famitsu,"" it was unable to catch up with Nintendo <7974>'s new game console ""Switch 2."" This seems to be due to the fact that the model does not have a disc drive, leading users who might consider using a disc drive to think, ""it's not worth buying."" Contrary to some media outlets' efforts to promote it, it seems to me that user interest in ""PlayStation"" is declining. Despite this significant price cut, looking at the weekly sales results, which lagged significantly behind ""Switch 2,"" I have to say that my previous prediction that ""the 'PlayStation' brand would decline"" was correct. Even when interviewing the company, they stated that the low market share in Japan was a factor in launching this Japan-exclusive model, so I believe they do have a sense of crisis. However, my honest opinion is that if they had taken my points more seriously and addressed them, the outcome might have been different. At the time, smartphone games were booming in Japan, and with the US market, which accounts for about half of the global market, becoming active, it's understandable that the company might have been inclined to neglect the Japanese market. While they developed a rigorous strategy for US market expansion, their management, which focused only on Microsoft as a relatively easy competitor to fight in Japan and Europe, inevitably led to the decline in PlayStation's presence in the Japanese market. Fortunately, the company's overall performance is strong, and it has financial resources. I sincerely hope they will strive to rebuild the Japanese market in their game business. ●Negative aspects of the AI boom: Rising prices for game consoles and electronic devices due to semiconductor shortages. Regarding electronic components and semiconductors, I would like to touch upon MegaChips <6875>'s first-half earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025). The company's main business is semiconductors for storing game software, but it is attracting attention because the stock price of SiTime, a US company in which MegaChips previously invested and partially sold its shares, has risen significantly. SiTime supplies timing devices, essential components for electronic devices, and has become a popular stock due to the AI (Artificial Intelligence) boom. Although its shareholding ratio has gradually decreased, the rise in SiTime's stock price has, conversely, increased MegaChips' asset value, leading to an upward revision of its full-year net profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 at the end of November. This seems to be due to the ability to sell SiTime shares at a higher price than previously planned. In AI-related fields, as I mentioned last month, US tech giants are making ""astonishing"" amounts of capital investment, causing a supply-demand imbalance for many electronic components, including not only GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) but also DRAM, flash memory, and HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Already, even memory for DIY PCs is seeing sales restrictions in stores. I believe readers may not yet fully grasp this, but if massive investments in AI continue at this pace, there's an atmosphere suggesting a significant impact on the game sector next year. The ""PS5"" reportedly managed to procure components cheaply in 2024, leading to repeated price cuts, but the future is uncertain. ""Switch 2"" also uses more DRAM and flash memory than its predecessor ""Switch,"" and considering the impact of Trump tariffs, the price situation is becoming unclear. If the price of memory and other components for ""Switch 2"" continues to rise, increasing cost burdens, we must anticipate a situation where losses could increase with higher sales volumes in 2026. Especially in 2026, the second year of ""Switch 2,"" it is a time when Nintendo would want to significantly increase sales with appropriate measures. Nintendo will need to carefully consider pricing and procurement volumes. In Japan, demand is strong, and a slight price increase would likely be tolerated. There might also be situations where price increases need to be considered in conjunction with measures like new color variations. I used game consoles as an example, but I believe the AI boom is also significantly impacting the prices of smartphones and PCs. I have also tried generative AI, and while I can certainly understand its high performance from its outputs, on the other hand, I have the impression that monetization is not quite succeeding yet. Whether this boom can be turned into a genuine trend will be questioned from the latter half of 2026 onwards. ●Expectations for Kintetsu, energized by popular V-Tuber events. In the railway sector, I would like to highlight Kintetsu Group Holdings <9041>. Although there were no major surprises in the first-half earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (April-September 2025) itself, the Expo effect is expected to reach 25 billion yen, significantly exceeding the initial plan of 12.5 billion yen. While such strong performance raises concerns about the impact in the second half and beyond, as I reported last time, the third ""Seven-Dimensional Student Council"" event, centered around Suo Sango from Nijisanji (a popular V-Tuber group operated by ANYCOLOR <5032>), is being held at Shima Spain Village. I also visited Shima Spain Village recently, and despite it being a weekday, I saw many young people at Ugata Station, the closest station to Spain Village, which reaffirmed the high popularity of V-Tubers. Mie Kotsu (under Mie Kotsu Group Holdings <3232>) has significantly increased bus services to Shima Spain Village, creating an impression completely different from its previous quiet image. According to Kintetsu Group, initial visitors to this event significantly increased compared to the previous one, and it is deeply moving to see an era where a single piece of video content can bring about such a change in visitor numbers. Usage of their Ise-Shima Limited Express is also strong, so I am looking forward to its future prospects. By the way, in the railway sector, a decrease in inbound tourism due to the rapid deterioration of Japan-China relations is cited as a concern. Of course, future trends will need to be closely monitored, but I do not anticipate a significant decrease. This is because inbound tourism has diversified compared to its early days, and it is no longer solely reliant on Chinese travelers. Finally, I would like to mention JR Kyushu <9142> again. While I already discussed the second-quarter earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (July-September 2025) last time, ""Nintendo FUKUOKA,"" which opened at ""JR Hakata City"" in November, is generating significant excitement. On the opening day, people reportedly started lining up from 5 AM, and the limited-time sale of hot chocolate with a mug was also a great success. While issues such as confusion over ticket distribution and reselling were observed on social media, I believe these incidents reaffirmed its high popularity. Rather, the media coverage of these events may have contributed to increasing the national recognition of ""JR Hakata City."" Railway companies tend to focus on customers along their lines, but revenue from tenant sales is also a significant source of income. I believe that by attracting a wide range of people, including those from the Tokyo metropolitan area, in addition to local demand, further growth can be achieved. While the earnings of each company were generally good, looking at the overall market, I believe there is certainly a bias towards AI stocks in terms of stock prices at present. Whether that base expands will be the dividing line between a bubble or not. I will continue to track and report on the trends of each company.",Stock Search News

The company announced on the 11th that it expects consolidated operating profit for the full fiscal year ending October 2026 to be 1.10 billion yen (down 38.7% year-on-year), and its annual dividend forecast to be 25 yen (25 yen in the previous fiscal year). While the optical business will proceed with price revisions and cost reductions, expenses related to addressing rare earth procurement risks are expected to arise. The electronics business is expected to be affected by a decline in profitability due to inventory adjustments for products for semiconductor lithography equipment, as well as the impact of U.S. tariff policies. Assumed exchange rates are 1 dollar = 150 yen and 1 euro = 165 yen. Consolidated operating profit for the full fiscal year ending October 2025 was 1.79 billion yen (down 17.6% from the previous fiscal year). This was impacted by a decrease in the operating rate of production facilities due to inventory adjustments for products for semiconductor lithography equipment, and changes in the product mix.★9:38 Ohara - Sharp Decline: Share Buyback Up to 630,000 Shares and 891 Million Yen; Ratio is 2.59%. Ohara <5218> saw a sharp decline. The company announced on the 11th that it has set up a share buyback framework with an upper limit of 630,000 shares and 891 million yen. The acquisition period is from December 12, 2025, to April 10, 2026. The acquisition method will be market purchases on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (including purchases via ToSTNeT-3 off-auction own share trading). If the maximum number of shares is acquired, the ratio to the total number of outstanding shares excluding treasury stock will be 2.59%. Furthermore, with the earnings announced on the same day forecasting a decrease in profit for the current fiscal year, selling pressure has become dominant.★9:39 Ridge-i - Sharp Decline: Q1 Operating Profit Down 29%; Large Satellite AI Project Completed and Moved to Maintenance and Operations Phase. Ridge-i <5572> saw a sharp decline. The company announced on the 11th that its consolidated operating profit for Q1 (August-October) of the fiscal year ending July 2026 was 71 million yen (down 29.1% year-on-year). This was impacted by the completion of a large satellite AI project from the previous fiscal year, which transitioned to the maintenance and operations phase, and a decrease in revenue due to a reduction in marketing projects from platform providers.★9:42 SoftBank Group - Surging: Reported to be in Talks to Acquire U.S. Data Center Operator Switch. SoftBank Group <9984> surged. Bloomberg reported at 8:59 AM on the 12th that the company is in talks to acquire Switch, a U.S. data center operator. According to the article, sources revealed this information. Agreement on transaction terms has not yet been reached, and it appears uncertain whether an actual deal will materialize. The acquisition of Switch would be one of the largest deals for the company to date, and it is expected to require a massive amount of funding.★9:42 Panasonic HD - Nomura Raises Target Price: Confidence in Growth Strategy Post-Structural Reform Increases. Panasonic Holdings <6752> continued its significant rally. Nomura Securities pointed out that confidence in the growth strategy post-structural reform is increasing. It maintained its 'Buy' investment rating and raised its target price from 2,400 yen to 2,500 yen. Nomura expects initiatives such as personnel optimization, consolidation and abolition of bases, and centralization and efficiency improvement of indirect functions to progress, leading to a 38% increase in operating profit (adjusted) for the fiscal year ending March 2027 compared to the previous fiscal year, due to the effects of structural reforms. It also anticipates profit improvements in individual businesses, such as the expansion of energy storage systems for data centers (DC) and the reduction of losses at Blue Yonder. The review of the business portfolio from a best owner perspective is also progressing, including the decision to sell the housing equipment business. It believes that the certainty of profit growth has increased, based on factors such as the order acquisition status for DCs towards 2028.★9:46 FCC - SMBC Nikko Raises Target Price: Awareness of Capital Efficiency Expected to Rise. FCC <7296> saw a significant four-day rally, interspersed with unchanged trading. SMBC Nikko Securities judged that awareness of capital efficiency would increase. It raised its investment rating from '2 (Neutral)' to '1 (Outperform)' and its target price from 3,600 yen to 4,200 yen. SMBC Nikko views FCC as the supplier that will benefit most from the current expansion of the two-wheeler market in India, where it holds a high market share. The sustainability of the clutch business is also increasing due to the strengthening of the HV/PHV business in the U.S. In the new medium-term plan, it notes that there remains room for enhanced shareholder returns aimed at curbing the rising equity ratio.★9:49 Top Culture - Surging: Forecasts Turn to Operating Profit for Current Fiscal Year; Previous Fiscal Year Saw Reduced Loss. Top Culture <7640> surged. The company announced on the 11th that it expects consolidated operating profit for the full fiscal year ending October 2026 to turn profitable at 400 million yen.

For the fiscal year ending October 2025, it reported a loss of 390 million yen (compared to a loss of 500 million yen in the previous fiscal year). While profitability improved at existing stores, the company incurred a loss due to a significant increase in costs associated with store closures and renovations.",Traders Web

SMBC Nikko Securities expects the continued expansion of eFootball's popularity. The investment rating was maintained at '1 (Outperform)', and the target price was raised from 20,000 yen to 28,000 yen. SMBC Nikko revised its earnings forecast for the fiscal years ending March 2026 to March 2029 and raised its operating profit primarily due to the better-than-expected performance of 'eFootball'. As of the company's announcement on September 18, the title had surpassed 900 million cumulative downloads worldwide, demonstrating its global popularity across Japan, Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Africa. SMBC Nikko assumes that the 30th-anniversary event from July, the quality improvements such as operability in the major update in August, and the implementation of new features were well-received, leading to an increase in active users. The rising popularity of soccer leading up to the 'FIFA World Cup' to be held in June 2026 is also expected to be a tailwind. ★12:59 Maxvalu Tokai - Rebounds with 3.8% increase in same-store sales for November Maxvalu Tokai (8198) rebounded. The company announced at 12:30 PM on the 8th that its same-store sales for November, based on preliminary figures, increased by 3.8% year-on-year. Same-store customer numbers increased by 1.2%, and same-store customer spending per visit rose by 2.6%. Same-store comparisons are calculated year-on-year, adjusted for stores that have been open for 12 months after their opening month (excluding the half-year period in which they opened) and closed stores. ★13:03 CSP - Daiwa downgrades investment rating, active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market needed CSP (3086) saw a slight decline. Daiwa Securities pointed out the need for active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market. The investment rating was downgraded from '2 (Outperform)' to '3 (Neutral)', and the target price was raised from 3,100 yen to 3,160 yen. Daiwa believes that while an increase in demand due to price hikes and a perceived deterioration in public safety has been observed for the two major security companies, CSP has not fully benefited from it. It was noted that, at present, it is difficult to envision concrete strategies for expanding the customer base, excluding M&A. Operating profit forecasts are 4.55 billion yen for the fiscal year ending February 2026 and 4.44 billion yen for the fiscal year ending February 2027. It is believed that the second-half performance depends on the timing of revenue recognition for the Takanawa project, and there is a possibility of it being heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. Furthermore, it was explained that active capital measures and dialogue with the stock market are required. ★13:06 SKY Perfect JSAT - Turns positive in afternoon session, signs launch contract for next-generation satellites with U.S. SpaceX SKY Perfect JSAT Holdings (9412) turned positive in the afternoon session. The company announced at 1:00 PM on the 8th that its wholly-owned subsidiary, SKY Perfect JSAT, has selected U.S. SpaceX as a partner and signed a contract for the launch services (rocket procurement and satellite launch transportation services) of communication satellites 'JSAT-31' and 'JSAT-32'. The three next-generation satellites, including 'Superbird-9' for which a contract has already been signed, are scheduled to be launched sequentially starting in 2027. ★13:13 Toyota Motor - Mizuho raises target price, strong sense of undervaluation when looking at next fiscal year's performance Toyota Motor (7203) rebounded. Mizuho Securities pointed out a strong sense of undervaluation when looking at next fiscal year's performance. The investment rating was maintained at 'Buy', and the target price was raised from 3,400 yen to 3,700 yen. Mizuho believes that the strength in sales, particularly in the U.S., remains intact, and with the introduction of the new RAV4 and the full HEV conversion of the RAV4, robust sales trends are expected to continue. Furthermore, in the interim financial results, the company indicated its intention to once again work on improving the break-even point in terms of units, so in addition to sales, trends in costs will also be noteworthy going forward. In addition, an increase in EPS is expected next fiscal year due to a share buyback from Toyota Industries Corporation. Considering these factors, the current stock price is seen as significantly undervalued when anticipating a recovery in next fiscal year's performance. ★13:15 Mitsubishi Electric - SMBC Nikko raises target price, expects continued momentum in capital efficiency improvement Mitsubishi Electric (6503) rebounded. SMBC Nikko Securities judged that the momentum for improving capital efficiency can be expected to continue. The investment rating was maintained at '1 (Outperform)', and the target price was raised from 4,100 yen to 4,600 yen. SMBC Nikko assumes that the momentum for improving capital efficiency will continue through growth centered on infrastructure (defense, DC UPS, power infrastructure), business restructuring, fixed cost reduction measures, and a commitment to strengthening shareholder returns. It is believed that the capital market's expectations will rise to a higher level. While the operating profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 was reduced, it was increased for the fiscal year ending March 2027. The effect of an annual 20 billion yen reduction in fixed costs from the fiscal year ending March 2027 onwards was reflected.",Traders Web

According to the Nikkei Shimbun morning edition dated the 6th, the company has developed a small-scale data center where components are produced in a factory and assembled on-site. According to the article, the construction period can be significantly shortened from the typical 5 years for a building-type to 1 year. As demand for data center construction increases with the spread of generative AI, the company expects demand mainly in regional areas and aims to contribute to the decentralization of data centers currently concentrated in the Tokyo metropolitan area and Kansai region. ★9:51 Komatsu - SMBC Nikko downgrades investment rating; Monitoring price pass-through trends Komatsu <6301> continued to fall. SMBC Nikko Securities is monitoring price pass-through trends. The investment rating was downgraded from '1 (Outperform)' to '2 (Neutral)', and the target stock price was lowered from 6,000 yen to 5,000 yen. SMBC Nikko believes that while the company's robust shareholder returns will continue to support the stock price, it is difficult to factor in expectations for the fiscal year ending March 2027 due to two points: the anticipated slowdown in demand in highly profitable Indonesia, and strong uncertainty regarding the price pass-through policy in response to US tariff impacts. Future catalysts are expected to be the elimination of these uncertainties. In the medium to long term, attention is focused on expanding market share in North America and increasing performance in underground mining machinery. ★9:51 Nagase & Co. - Daiwa raises target stock price; Focus on high competitive advantage in encapsulating materials for advanced semiconductors, etc. Nagase & Co. <8012> remained firm. Daiwa Securities is focusing on the high competitive advantage in encapsulating materials for advanced semiconductors, among other factors. The investment rating was maintained at '2 (Outperform)', and the target stock price was raised from 4,000 yen to 4,900 yen. Daiwa forecasts operating profit of 42.0 billion yen for FY26/3 (previous 42.0 billion yen, company plan 40.7 billion yen), 45.0 billion yen for FY27/3 (previous 45.0 billion yen), and 47.0 billion yen for FY28/3 (previous 47.0 billion yen). Since the company has not yet decided on the total shareholder return ratio target for FY27/3 and beyond, Daiwa conservatively assumes it, but believes there is significant upside potential in reality. Key points of focus include: (1) strong undervaluation based on total shareholder return yield within the trading company sector, (2) proactive stance towards improving shareholder returns, (3) adoption of a continuous dividend increase policy, and (4) high competitive advantage in encapsulating materials for advanced semiconductors, which are expected to see high growth in the medium to long term within the semiconductor market. ★10:01 Mitsui & Co. - Rebounds; New LNG production in Australia for the first time in 5 years; 10% increase in global equity = Nikkei Mitsui & Co. <8031> rebounded. According to the Nikkei Shimbun morning edition dated the 8th, the company will begin new production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Australia within 2025. According to the article, this LNG will originate from gas fields in Western Australia, with production expected to be around 700,000 tons per year on an equity basis. This marks the first new LNG production at a company in which Mitsui & Co. has an investment in 5 years. If fully operational, the company's equity share of LNG production is expected to increase by a simple calculation of 10% from current levels to approximately 6.7 million tons per year. ★10:10 Takeuchi Mfg. - SMBC Nikko downgrades investment rating; Overvalued given the risk of sluggish performance in FY27/2 Takeuchi Mfg. <6432> plunged. SMBC Nikko Securities judged the stock price to be overvalued given the risk of sluggish performance in the fiscal year ending February 2027. The investment rating was downgraded from '2 (Neutral)' to '3 (Underperform)', and the target stock price was raised from 4,600 yen to 5,000 yen. SMBC Nikko expects the full-year plan to be missed given the current housing market environment. Furthermore, for FY27/2, a significant decline in profit is anticipated due to a decrease in sales volume resulting from the peaking out of order backlogs and the impact of US tariffs. Amidst this, the P/E ratio based on the estimated EPS for FY27/2 is approximately 16x, which is the highest level in the past 10 years, leading to a perception of overvaluation and a judgment that there is significant downside risk for the stock price. The catalyst is considered to be the announcement of the company's plan for FY27/2. ★10:15 Enomoto - Substantially continues to rise; fundnote increases its stake in the company; Holding ratio increases from 7.66% to 9.93% Enomoto <6928> substantially continued to rise.

Amid lingering concerns about a Taiwan contingency involving China, Chinese military fighter jets illuminated Japan Self-Defense Forces fighter jets with radar on the 6th, indicating increasing pressure on Japan from the Chinese side. In this context, US Secretary of Defense Hegges's speech on the 6th, in which he called for allies such as Japan to introduce a target of raising defense spending to 5% of GDP within a few years, stimulated the stock prices of defense-related companies. As many defense-related stocks, including Mitsubishi Heavy, had undergone significant adjustments in the November market, buying based on a sense of value has become easier in the short term. ■Nishimatsu Construction <1820> 5,781 yen +168 yen (+3.0%) Today's closing price.

The effective date for the share transfer is scheduled for November 1, 2026, and the transfer price has not been disclosed. ■HI-LEX <7279> 2,937 yen +63 yen (+2.2%) Today's closing price.

SKY Perfect JSAT Holdings <9412> renewed its year-to-date high for consecutive days. Around 1:00 PM on the 8th, the company announced that its subsidiary had signed a launch contract with US SpaceX for two next-generation communication satellites.

By deploying more effective and efficient multi-band communication services, the company aims to meet expanding mobility demand in areas such as in-flight internet connectivity and national security. ■Hodogaya Chemical <4112> 1,938 yen +40 yen (+2.1%) Today's closing price.

Technically, it has broken out of a mid-range consolidation with the appearance of a large bullish candlestick, suggesting the initial phase of a major two-stage rally. Amid prominent buybacks in semiconductor-related stocks in the U.S., there are voices saying, ""Investment funds have started to focus on the semiconductor-related materials sector (chemical stocks) in the Tokyo market, which has been lagging"" (according to a mid-tier securities strategist).

Its subsidiary, Nissin Foods, announced on the 3rd that it would raise the prices of instant bagged noodles, instant cup noodles, and instant cup soups for shipments starting April 1, 2026. Improved profitability is expected as a result. Amid continued soaring prices for main raw materials and packaging materials, and rising logistics costs, the company determined that it would be difficult to absorb the increased costs through self-help efforts alone. The revised prices will result in a 5-11% increase in the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Additionally, the company plans to change the content volume of some instant bagged noodles and instant cup rice, reducing it by 7-17% for products re-released on April 6 next year. ■INPEX Corporation <1605> 3,210 yen +77 yen (+2.5%) Closing Price Today INPEX Corporation <1605> rebounded for the first time in four days.

Amidst generally strong movements in leading semiconductor stocks, the company's strong upward momentum stands out particularly. While manufacturers with a high weighting in AI semiconductors for post-process manufacturing equipment have demonstrated stock price superiority until now, a rotation of funds is now observed towards front-process manufacturing equipment manufacturers focused on miniaturization, such as the company's stock, which had been relatively lagging. In particular, ASML Holding <ASML> of the Netherlands, a major customer of the company, has recently been bought in the US stock market, hitting an all-time high with an exceptional seven consecutive days of gains until the previous day, which is currently a strong stock price catalyst. Aisan Technology <4667> = Popular among investors. In addition to developing surveying software for architecture and civil engineering, the company has actively expanded into the mobility and DX (Digital Transformation) sectors from an early stage, accumulating achievements in the autonomous driving field. Currently, in the Tokyo market, robot-related stocks are experiencing a sudden surge in investor interest, centered around Fanuc <6954>, which has rapidly gained popularity from the perspective of physical AI. Physical AI has become a globally highly anticipated theme, including companies like Nvidia, and its integration with AI is a major future challenge in the autonomous driving sector, similar to robotics. The company has high market recognition as a promising related stock, attracting buying interest. Shin-Etsu Chemical <4063> = Showing strong signs of upward movement. Recovered to the 4,800 yen level for the first time in about a month. Technically, it has broken out of a mid-range consolidation with the appearance of a large bullish candlestick, suggesting the initial phase of a major two-stage rally. Amidst prominent buybacks in semiconductor-related stocks in the US, there are voices (from a mid-tier securities strategist) saying, ""Investment funds have started to turn their attention to the semiconductor-related materials sector (chemical stocks) in the Tokyo market, which has been lagging."" In this context, the company, as the world's top manufacturer of semiconductor silicon wafers, is experiencing strong tailwinds. The company is also one of Japan's leading players in photoresists, used to form semiconductor circuits, and attracts high attention from overseas investors. Furthermore, triggered by China's export restrictions on rare earths due to political reasons, speculative price movements have been observed in related stocks in this field. However, the company possesses world-class rare earth refining technology, which could elevate its recognition as a key company in terms of national policy. Hirata Corp. <6258> = Strong upward momentum, new high. After the close of trading on the 3rd, the company announced that it will start inspection services for products containing cannabis-derived ingredients (CBD-containing products) from February 2026. CBD, a cannabis-derived ingredient, is expected to offer various health benefits such as relaxation, better sleep, and pain relief. Its safety has been confirmed by the World Health Organization, leading to a global expansion of the related market. Although market expansion is also expected domestically, manufacturers of CBD-containing products are legally obligated to inspect for residual narcotic components, and the company appears to aim to capture this demand. It seems to be bought on this news. Nihon Kohden <6849> = Sharp rebound, signaling a recovery. Rebounding significantly for the first time in six days. It opened with a gap up and jumped over the 5-day moving average, creating an impression of a bottoming-out and reversal. As a specialized manufacturer of medical electronic equipment, it has high product competitiveness and boasts a top share in products such as electroencephalographs (EEGs). For the fiscal year ending March 2026, sales are expected to reach a new record high for consecutive periods, and operating profit is also projected to see double-digit growth, indicating strong performance. Amidst this, the company announced on the 3rd the establishment of a share buyback program. The program allows for the acquisition of up to 3.8 million shares, equivalent to 2.33% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury stock), or up to 5 billion yen in value, with the acquisition period extending until the end of March next year (a portion of which was acquired in off-hours trading this morning). This attracted buying interest, anticipating an improvement in the supply-demand balance of the shares. TOWA <6315> = Continued rise. At one point, it surged by 6.7%. In the medium term, it continues an upward trend with the 26-week moving average acting as a support line. Leveraging its high technological capabilities cultivated through ultra-precision molds, it boasts world-leading product competitiveness in semiconductor resin encapsulation equipment (molding equipment). While Nvidia <NVDA> stock has been somewhat lackluster in the US stock market recently, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index), composed of semiconductor stocks, has shown strong upward momentum, forming bullish candlesticks for eight consecutive days until the previous day. The company's compression equipment for HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), which is installed with GPUs for AI servers, is capturing high demand, and this is expected to drive double-digit operating profit growth this fiscal year. The 2,000 yen level has served as the lower bound of a two-and-a-half-month trading range for the stock price, and buying activity is currently observed, anticipating a rebound. Blue Innovation <5597> = Significant continued rise. After the close of trading on the 3rd, the company announced that it had signed a brand license agreement with AeroProbing, a Taiwanese drone manufacturer, which is viewed as positive news. The aim of this agreement is to build a cooperative framework for creating new value in the Asian market by mutually leveraging the technological capabilities and business experience that both companies have cultivated. Based on this, Blue Innovation will commence full-scale expansion into the Asian market from January 2026.",Minkabu
